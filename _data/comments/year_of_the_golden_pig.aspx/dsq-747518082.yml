message: <p>Exactly, my parents have never heard of the Golden Pig Year and they have been born and raised in china. Imagine millions of children born this year and all those wealthy children, gee what chaos would this world be in, it would be unjust, its bull. Its a myth right, no scientific fact? Well, im not that type who believes in myths. I believe in christianity, where they support science because its the discovery of our world. Not like these horoscopes myth shit that could be fake or not. No offence to any believers.</p>
