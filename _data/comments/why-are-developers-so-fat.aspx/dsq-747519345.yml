message: <p>Sleep man, sleep :-D<br>I read about this in some papers and heard about it from radio.  More than eating, sleeping affects our bodies and makes us fat.  As long as we don't sleep, we feel hungry during day and eat more and more and this is the main reason to become so fat!<br>Since I got off to military training and returned to normal life (sleeping for 6-8 hours per day) I lost 8-9 KG and now feel better.</p>
