message: <p>I had always hoped for a hybrid of MVC, webforms. there are things in LOB applications that are data entry intensive that you just dont see in public facing web applications that I dont think are there yet. ie. selecting a state/province and it updates the available set of area codes in telephone number input boxes to choose most likely first.  <br>I know that MVC can do this but it doesnt  fall in the realm of easy or productive. But ehwere mvc make sense I can see the appeal.<br></p>
