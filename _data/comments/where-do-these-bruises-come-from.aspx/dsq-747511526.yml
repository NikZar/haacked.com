message: <p>Tell Akumi to talk to Susan.  I've been known to soccer kick just as I fall asleep.  She's learned to anticipate and deflect the blow.  Apparently the kick usually wakes me up enough to mumble, "ugh, huh...oh...sorry...zzzzzz."  I never remember it in the morning so it could be all lies to justify her smacking me around all day.</p>
