message: <p>Congratulations Phil! Can't wait to witness the impact you make over as a GitHubberatus. I've been lazily learning how to use git over the past year on my own through the help of all the great community docs and those awesome @robconery @tekpub videos, but haven't really to use it for anything that pays the bills yet. This news gives me that extra boost to learn, I actually feel like I have something at stake again. The tide is rising and all the boats are lifting! :)</p>
