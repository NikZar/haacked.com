message: <p>Man, I can't believe it. Haacked a GitHubber, which means that we .NET developers should thanks God. My first feedback is to integrate GitHub with Visual Studio (yeah, I know, plugins are already out there, but nothing like TFS), so that .NET developers can really work with GitHub like TFS.</p>
