message: <p>There is no wonder why very very few C# developers use GitHub - first there was SourceForge, than CodePlex, and now GitHub - since most open-source projects use them just for centralized source control, most saw no reason for switching everything to yet another site, just for being hip and cool..<br>Adding to this, Microsoft actively discourages any project that is not on CodePlex, so in order to be "accepted" in a MS-only-shop, a component must come from CodePlex..</p>
