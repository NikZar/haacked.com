message: <p>Congrats man.  I love github but hate git.  The learning curve is insane.  I just trained a team overseas on using mercurial and they were up and running in less than an hour.  <br>These guys came from a source safe/TFS background, but they still got mercurial right away.  It would have been impossible to get them to adopt git.<br>Bitbucket gives me unlimited private repositories for free, so it is a no-brainer.  They even support git.  But github website is hands down a much better site.<br>Add mercurial support and I will signup on day 1.<br></p>
