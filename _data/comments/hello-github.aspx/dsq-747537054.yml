message: <p>Like Hector Minaya said.<br>It would be so great if you develop a alternative to the TFS integration in VS 2010, like bug and feature management, and for sure code checkIn and checkout based on GitHub!<br>Then I think, many .NET Developers will move because the TFS is very very expensive and no hobby developer or one man company can spend so much money for it.<br>Best regards</p>
