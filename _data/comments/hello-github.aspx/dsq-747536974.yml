message: <p>Congrats Phil and I am pretty damn sure that you will succeed at GitHub as much as you did at Microsoft.<br>Only change for me is that I had to move the tag 'Microsoftie' from your blog's feed away on Google Reader and I will add GitHubber, Hubbernaut, GitHubberati to that (even that you made the last one up ;))</p>
