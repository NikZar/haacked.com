message: <p>--"I, too, see "Git" and think "pain to use in Windows" and FAR more complicated to use than Mercurial."<br>My thoughts exactly. I _really_ want to use GitHub (I have issues with BitBucket), but, I have "designers" committing HTML and they just scrape by with TortoiseHG, Git would be impossible.<br>+1 Github mercurial support :)<br>Also, congrats to your Phil, appreciate all the work you've done on .Net.</p>
