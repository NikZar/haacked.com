message: <p>today i made the first cowbell reference in years, and suddenly it appears here, too. amazing.<br>apart from that, really cool. i am amazed c# doesnt make it it to the top 10, considering that pretty much all oss i love in the .net land is hosted on github.<br>soo, will we get some  interesting nuget integration in github? sth like hosted build server with nuget coming out at the end?<br>well, who knows, looking forward!</p>
