message: <p>Interesting article.  Many people subscribe to the Theory X management style.  So what happens in a great Theory Y company when a leg of the company, perhaps a VP and lower manager, are solidly Theory X.  The employees expect to be treated in the Theory Y manner, but the micromanagement, belittling and harsh environment of this one section allows a toxic waste of harried employees.  Further stress factors to this points to a pseudo-allusion on the eyes of the rest of the company about this "leg" of the company.  Employees that leave are deemed "non productive" or bad apples to the HR and other Executive staff.  Mixing a Theory X and Theory Y can be quite toxic... hopefully, the company will deal with the issues and resolve them before the company implodes.</p>
