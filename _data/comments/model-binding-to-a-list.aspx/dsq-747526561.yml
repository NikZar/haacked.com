message: <p>@Brett<br>Thanks!  That was a big help.  Although it only worked when I had a generic list, so instead of:<br>public ActionResult UpdateProducts(IList products)<br>I have:<br>public ActionResult UpdateProducts(IList&lt;product&gt; products)<br>Otherwise I just get an empty list.<br></p>
