message: <p>"HAHA! You'll never catch me!"<br>The above is what everyone says when they snatch code from the 'net. And, truthfully, what are you gonna do about it? <br>Unless a project becomes so successful that it catches your attention, you have no choice but a public domain license. I'm in the mindset that licenses suck ass! <br>Unless you have a commercial product that the code is somehow secret and original, code is code that teaches people. Period! And, if not, you have no business publishing such code.</p>
