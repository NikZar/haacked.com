message: <p>Was sent the link to ActionPack this morning from a friend and I am very impressed.  Watching the video outlining the functionality makes you think how much development time you can save.  In the near future I think I'll be using along side the application data block.<br>The scaffold idea is so handy.  I can see many uses for this.<br>Well done to the development team will be good to see what the next versions will have.<br><br>Si</p>
