message: <p>@ScottEg,<br>Yes this is possible in Razor using the following in your Layout page:<br>@RednderSection("someSectionName" options:true).<br>What that says is the section is optional and Views can choose the render/implement the section.<br>In a view in which you wish to implement this section, simply do<br>@section someSetionName {<br>&lt;h2&gt;This is an optional section, but rendered in this view&lt;/h2&gt;<br>}</p>
