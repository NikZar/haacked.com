message: '<p>This is an old post but I wanted to vote on something for MVC 3.  The razor syntax is sweet by the way.  My vote: I want to see stronger jquery validation support using data annotations while using jquery ajax.  I would like to see the jquery validation/ajax combinations to play nice with the newer .net 4.0 features, like data annotations for validation.</p>'
