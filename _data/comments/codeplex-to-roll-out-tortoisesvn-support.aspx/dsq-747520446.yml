message: <p>Jonathan Wanagel commented on Ayende's blog that TFS doesn't scale with anonymous access - it would have to if Tortoise sat on it wouldn't it?<br>My thinking on this is that if they try to roll out Tortoise as some sort of appeasement for Subversion it would really be Marie Antoinettish of them.<br>If they do roll out Subversion - SubSonic is sooooo there.</p>
