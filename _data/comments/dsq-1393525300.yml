message: <p>I'm very interested in the topic after spending two years in Redmond. I enjoyed the little bits of contact I had with you and Brad around MVC back in the day, and you should be proud to have helped plant some of these seeds. Maybe I would still be there if things moved faster... it's hard to say. I did have a meeting once with Satya in the room, and I was blown away by him. Really smart guy. I was relieved when they gave him the CEO gig.</p>
