message: "<p>@Thanigainathan - Just to follow up on Phil's answer: Razor uses exactly the same compilation model as ASPX, so the performance after the first request is very similar to ASPX. Razor does take a little more time to do that initial compilation due to it being a more complex language to parse, but that's only on the first request.</p>"
