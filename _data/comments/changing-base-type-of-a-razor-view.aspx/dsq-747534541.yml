message: <p>This article helped me a lot, thanks.  There is one problem with the code sample, however, and that is the base class on CustomWebViewPage&lt;TModel&gt;.  It is shown as CustomWebViewPage, which compiles, but throws a runtime error when you load a model bound page.  The only solution to this, that I could find was having multiple CustomWebView pages that derive from WebViewPage and WebViewPage&lt;T&gt;.</p>
