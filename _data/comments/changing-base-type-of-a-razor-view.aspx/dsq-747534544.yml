message: <p>Thanks a lot Phil! I was looking everywhere on how to do this. I ended up using ILSpy on the RazorViewEngine to figure out that its initializing the helpers in the WebViewPage.  After finding the correct terminology and using Bing. I found this page. Exactly what I was looking for.  Thanks again.</p>
