message: <p>@Kouroush Looks like you mispelled it. It should be <code>CustomWebViewPage</code> not <code>CustomWebVeiwPage</code>.<br>@Nathan, I'm not sure.<br>@Allan, the class is created and compiled very early in the pipeline once. The execute method is called much later.<br>@Refocus Yes, you can. Takes a bit of work though.<br>@Thanigainathan It's only a perf hit on the first request. After that, it's very fast because it's all compiled.</p>
