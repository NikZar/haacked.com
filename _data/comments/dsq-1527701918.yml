message: <p>What if you've moved from Google Blog writer system and want to protect your comments? I've handled to transfer them, and modify the URL's they were allocated to, but Disqus has given all the customer's a Disqus current e-mail deal with, so all feedback I created in response to other individuals now do not appear as me, even though I sign in to Disqus with the same e-mail consideration as I did for leaving comments on Blog writer.</p><p><a href="http://spybubblez.com.br/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://spybubblez.com.br/">Spybubble</a> <br></p>
