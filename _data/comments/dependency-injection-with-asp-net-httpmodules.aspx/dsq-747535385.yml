message: <p>Thanks for this Phil, made my day.<br>Having worked on some PHP-applications using frameworks like Symfony, I'm fairly new to ASP.NET and this is exactly what I needed (I need to investigate and learn a lot more). Thanks again!<br>About that tweet you mentioned, I don't agree... DI and unit testing = great!</p>
