message: <p>How do you install Git on Windows in the first place?  The last time I did (it has been a year or more), I think I tried "msysgit" and had nothing but problems (like, it changed my system fonts and never worked properly).  <br>I have used Mercurial ever since, but would like to try Git. Is there a better way to install it without screwing up Windows?</p>
