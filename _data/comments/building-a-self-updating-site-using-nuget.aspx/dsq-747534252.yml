message: '<p>Very impressive demo, but IÂ´m a bit confused: I thought NuGet would be a kind of library repository. In your demo you use it for a whole web application - which is very cool. But should this "deployment task" not handled via WebDeploy? If I want to build a system like "Wordpress", should I upload new releases on MS WebApp Gallery for the Web Platform Installer AND on the NuGet Gallery? <br>SRP violation? ;)</p>'
