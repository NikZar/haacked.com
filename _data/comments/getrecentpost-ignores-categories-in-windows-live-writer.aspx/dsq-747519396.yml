message: <p>Hi there,<br>WLW has a bug (actually more of a "limitation") in that we never pick up changes to the server at all if we already have a local copy. This will be fixed in the next release, including categories.<br>I believe Community Server has/had their own bug where the categories were never returned. But if you are looking in Fiddler and the responses look OK, then our next release will fix it.<br>Thanks...</p>
