message: <p>Hi Phil,<br>I've been trying to get the author one of my favourite OS projects Genuilder (an AMAZING code pre-processor) to put it on NuGet, but the problem is that it needs to add a custom msbuild target into the project. Is there any way to alter the csproj file currently in NuGet?</p>
