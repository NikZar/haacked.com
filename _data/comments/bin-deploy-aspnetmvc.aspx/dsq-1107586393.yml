message: <p>GSCopy<br>Pro v6.0 (RoboCopy Alternative) with Open File Agent</p><p>GSCopyPro is a single command-line<br>tool (CLI) that can copy, replicate and move files from one folder to another.<br>This folder can be on the same machine/ server or another server elsewhere.<br>What makes GSCopyPro stand out from other competitors is the<br>fact it works on 32-bit as well as 64-bit systems and has no restrictions. It can easily be scheduled to run as a scheduled task<br>and fully automated. GSCopyPro also comes with an open file agent which can<br>copy files that are locked/ opened by other processes. This feature is<br>supported in all windows vSCersions from widows XP/ 2003 and later.</p><p>Go To:&gt;&gt; <a href="http://www.gurusquad.com/GOPYPRO" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.gurusquad.com/GOPYPRO">http://www.gurusquad.com/GO...</a></p>
