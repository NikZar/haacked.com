message: <p>GSCopy<br>Pro v6.0 (RoboCopy Alternative) with Open File Agent</p><p>GSCopyPro is<br>a single command-line tool (CLI) that can copy, replicate and move files from<br>one folder to another. This folder can be on the same machine/ server or<br>another server elsewhere. What makes GSCopyPro stand out from other competitors is the fact it works on 32-bit as well as 64-bit<br>systems and has no restrictions. It can easily be scheduled to run as<br>a scheduled task and fully automated. GSCopyPro also comes with an open file<br>agent which can copy files that are locked/ opened by other processes. This<br>feature is supported in all windows versions from widows XP/ 2003 and later.</p><p>Go<br>To:&gt;&gt; <a href="http://www.gurusquad.com/GSCOPYPRO" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.gurusquad.com/GSCOPYPRO">http://www.gurusquad.com/GS...</a></p>
