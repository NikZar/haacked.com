message: "<p>One important point of the video was to clarify that unlike in a program the series won't be interupted in the real world. All is happening at the same time. You can't simulate this with such a program.</p><p>Another point: In math you can define whatever axioms you want, but if they contradict the physical laws in our universe then they are pretty useless (only of theoretical value). I don't think it's the case here, but it's still an important factor. If math predicts a different outcome, then we need to fix the math. <br></p>"
