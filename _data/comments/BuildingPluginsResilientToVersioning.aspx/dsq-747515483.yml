message: <p>You wrote very well Phil. I agree with what you said and also would like to add Castle Project's Inversion of Control design pattern which can be found at <a href="http://www.castleproject.org/index.php/Container" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.castleproject.org/index.php/Container">IoC</a>. I don't have any experience with it but looks like can be implemented for a plugin architecture.</p>
