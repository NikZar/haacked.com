message: <p>I am more a Dry Martini guy (Bombay Sapphire &amp; Noilly Prat equal parts + orange bitters, garnish just with lemon twist, forget the olive!), but I use to mix a Manhattan for my father-in-law once a week. Here in Spain we have some limitations regarding bourbons (I use Jack Daniels) but we got an excellent red vermouth (Yzaguirre Reserva) that gives a very powerful aroma to the cocktail.</p>
