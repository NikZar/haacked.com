message: <p>Hi! If you need to translate software strings, I would suggest to evaluate an online localization service like <a href="https://poeditor.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://poeditor.com/">https://poeditor.com/</a> that can improve the localization workflow a lot. Good to know it is free for open source projects.</p>
