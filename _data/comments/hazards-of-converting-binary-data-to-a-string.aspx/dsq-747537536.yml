message: <p>Hey Phil,<br>Thank you for pointing this out, not that I knew this was an issue.  But more importantly, it's crazy how bad the sample encryption code is out there on the internet.  Recently I tried to dive into it a little, but found an enormous amount of insecure or incorrect code.<br>From that endeavor I decided to create a project on Github that is designed to be "idiot-proof" symmetrical encryption using AES in .NET.  Well, maybe not idiot-proof but as close as we can get.  I would love for you and the other readers to take a look, and let me know what you think!<br><a href="https://github.com/jbubriski/Encryptamajig" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://github.com/jbubriski/Encryptamajig">The Encryptamajig on Github</a></p>
