I have to admit I can get very bullish about certain things (and almost extremist myself) that I believe very strongly have a lot of benefit with very little downside.<br><br><br><br>For example, I'd say that 99.9% of professional software developers are in a situation where it really makes really good sense to use version control.  Given that percentage, I will tend to say that "All Developers Should Use Version Control."<br><br><br><br>Of course, that's not true.  But the exceptions to the rule are so few, it's understandable why I'd make such an extreme statement.  I feel that way about unit testing.  <br><br><br><br>That if implemented in a reasonable manner, it benefits so many developers, pretty much every professional developer can gain some benefit from it.<br><br><br><br>Certainly not ALL developers, but a large number of them.</p>
