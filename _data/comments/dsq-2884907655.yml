message: <p>My go-to Manhattan is made with Rittenhouse Rye, Carpano Antica Italian vermouth and Luxardo cherries. Rittenhouse is an excellent vin ordinaire rye, but at 100 proof, it stands up well to the amount of watering down that a well-chilled Manhattan goes through. The Carpano Antica vermouth is aromatic enough that it works both as vermouth and bitters. It's a bit on the expensive side, but it lasts. Finally, the Luxardo cherries are genuine maraschino cherries in a thick (non-alcoholic) syrup. They're firm and tart without having the medicinal taste that maraschino cherries from your typical liquor store have. They're also a bit expensive -- probably around $20 for a container, but a container will last you for probably 50 Manhattans, so (IMO) it's worth it.</p>
