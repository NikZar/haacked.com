message: <p>Not in every possible case. Sometimes you need to create a temporary stream and dispose of it. Or you're implementing a wrapper class+interface for a type that doesn't implement an interface. So you inject your wrapper but keep the instance being wrapped from bleeding into the public API.</p>
