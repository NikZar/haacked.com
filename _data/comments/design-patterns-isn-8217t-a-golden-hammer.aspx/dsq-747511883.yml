message: <p>Well done! Great article and spot on with patterns. <br>Trust me, if you design and write good code. You will satisfy a pattern some where some how. I have come across so many patterns that I've unknowingly implemented, only because the creator of the pattern and myself came to the same implementation conclusion. <br>Create your own patterns that works for you!<br></p>
