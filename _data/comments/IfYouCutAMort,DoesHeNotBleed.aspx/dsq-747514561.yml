message: <p>I didn't know the name for myself, but I suppose I'm 'Mort.' :-\ A year ago I was writing whatever code (through the IDE or off the 'net) I could just to get stuff to work. Fortunately, I've been learning and improving my skills over the past year to where I now have a plan before I start and a lot less spaghetti when I'm done, but apparently the 'serious' developers out there would still call me 'Mort' based on my experience. Oh well.<br>In all fairness, I think I'm getting a handle on this OOP stuff. ;-)</p>
