message: <p>Phil,<br><br><br><br>Often with these promotions, you are required to make a minimum number of purchases in order to foil your most recent ploy to take advantage of that offer.  I can't say if BofA includes this type of restriction in its fine print, but it is worth looking for it.  Also, this looks like a classic "class action" lawsuit type situation.  If Blockbuster can be successfully sued for its misleading no late fee policy, the credit card companies should not get away with a misleading no interest policy.</p>
