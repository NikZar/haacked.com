message: <p>I've gotten so tired of receiving credit card solicitations that at first I would simply rip them in half and toss them in the mail.  What I do now, is return the postage paid envelope empty.  So, now I enjoy receiving this junk mail for each day I have an empty envelope to return, sometimes 3.  In this small way I get back at the credit card companies.</p>
