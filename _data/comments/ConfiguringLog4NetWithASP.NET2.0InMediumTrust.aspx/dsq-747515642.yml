message: <p>Dear Sir,<br>Thank you for providing the information.  However, you have made a lot of assumptions in your article that make it hard to recreate.  Can you be more concise as to what xml element goes where in the web.config?  I am having a hard time guessing of what to do while trying to follow your code.</p>
