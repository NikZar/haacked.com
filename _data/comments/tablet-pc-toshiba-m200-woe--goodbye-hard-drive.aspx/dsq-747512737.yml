message: <p>My M200 has been back to Toshiba 3 times. all with Hard Drive failures. I have to say that Toshiba has been more than fair. They have replaced the drive twice while the computer was out of warranty at no cost to me. Apparently this is a Lemon System and they have realized its problem and feel its better to take care of their long term customers.</p>
