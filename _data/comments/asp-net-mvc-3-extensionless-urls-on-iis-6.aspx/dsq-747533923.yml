message: <p>Just installed this on an IIS6 machine and was up and running in no time. My only issue is I have a route which ends in .xml thatâ€™s not fully working. If I add .xml so .net handles it then the route loads and I see my auto generated sitemap, but then actual xml files stop being served up.</p>
