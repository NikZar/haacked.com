message: "<p>I had the following problem: one ASP.Net MVC 2 worked fine in IIS 6 with .Net 4 installed and the another gave me the 403 error.<br>The difference was the application name (and the directory name): The one that didn't work has dots '.' in its name, e.g. Namespace1.ProjectName.WebMVC. <br>Changing it to Namespace1_ProjectName_WebMVC solved the problem</p>"
