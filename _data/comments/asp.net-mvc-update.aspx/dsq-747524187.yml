message: <p>Apart from ASP.NET MVC being a good thing (tm), the way it's being developed is also very good. Early releases, input, direct feedback channels, output etc. I hope that in the future the whole ASP.NET stack will be handled like this.<br>If ever you have a free afternoon, invite the guys from the IE team over and show them the positive feedback and appreciation and compare it to the b*tching they get on their blog. Maybe it will open their eyes to see that this way of development (open) benefits everyone.</p>
