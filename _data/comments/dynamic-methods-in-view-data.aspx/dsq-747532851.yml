message: <p>A few curious questions I had when I first saw this was, 1)Would ViewData be eventually deprecated in future MVC versions? 2) Is the dynamic View essentially injecting into ViewData? 3) If point 1 is true, does this mean MVC would eventually be for .NET 4.0+ only, since previous frameworks don't support dynamic.<br>Cheers,<br><br>Winston</p>
