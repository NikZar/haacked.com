message: <p>Interesting story and it's good to know about the new class. I'll be needing that very soon :)<br>By the way, 'rz' and 'sz' are in fact single sounds (rz reads like -ge in 'collage', and sz reads like -sh in 'Polish'). So Krzysztof's name is in fact a bit simpler than it looks like ;)</p>
