message: <p>Thanks, I've implemented Options based on what you've done here, with proper saving and reverting changes.  My visual studio extension, MVVM Tools, is available as an example at <a href="https://github.com/cbordeman/Mvvm-Tools" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://github.com/cbordeman/Mvvm-Tools">https://github.com/cbordema...</a>.  It works for VS2010+.</p>
