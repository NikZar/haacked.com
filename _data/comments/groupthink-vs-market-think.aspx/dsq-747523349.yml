message: <p>Its true, prediction markets are extremely accurate, because when people have a vested interest to predict correctly - suddenly there becomes little conflict of interest such as in decision by committee.. and it becomes every man trying desparately to guess correctly. Which has only one outcome - prediction markets offer great thought leadership on what the likely outcome of events or decisions will be.</p>
