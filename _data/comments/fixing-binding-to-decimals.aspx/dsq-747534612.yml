message: <p>I was suffering with this issue past week. I live in Brazil and I was very upset because I couldn't make it work. Thanks for the post. ASP.NET MVC 3 is very nice, but sometimes it looks like the globalization features were put in second place.<br>p.s. I hope you can get here in Rio de Janeiro sometime in the future to talk to us.</p>
