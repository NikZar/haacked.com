message: <p>Hi @Phil, you mention this works with complex objects but its not for me. The break point I set on the custom binder is only hit when I have a decimal as a route value directly e.g. RandomController(decimal someNumber) and not inside a complex binding RandomController(ComplexObj obj). Can anyone help?</p>
