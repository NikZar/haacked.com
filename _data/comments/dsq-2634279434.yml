message: <p>Good overall article. However, one point where I disagree with the Netflix model is that there's zero job security. That would typically make everyone a professional consultant, which implies higher pay since consultants must live "gig to gig." Re-branding a consultancy as a "job" by slapping on some (relatively cheap) benefits packages allows you to market your "jobs" as paying "top of market salaries," when, in fact, if you reconsidered those workers as consultants or private contractors (which is more or less practically what they are), the pay is probably just middling. Food for thought.</p>
