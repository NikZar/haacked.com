message: <p>Ability is a negative qualifier. I've known people who should not be programmers. (And they weren't, thank goodness.)<br>For programmers, one of the things I look for has been whether or not the person likes playing with technology and seeing how things work. If they have that techie spirit, it's a good sign. That means that they'll develop the skills they have and add new new ones because it's fun. Otherwise, you'll get someone who's competent, but probably won't grow much.</p>
