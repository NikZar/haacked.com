message: <p>I'm trying to use something like this to build a CMS (in 4.0) that uses a catch-all and constraints to determine which URLs to handle. The problem I'm getting is that catch-all/wildcards don't catch URLs with a trailing slash (/). I know it's a bit off topic, but do you know a way to catch the trailing slash on a catch-all?</p>
