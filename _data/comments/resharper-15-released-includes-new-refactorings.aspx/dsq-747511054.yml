message: <p>Don't worry, the EAP for ReSharper 2.0 will be starting in about 2 months -- for both VS .NET 2003 and 2005 ... as always, ReSharper is gonna add MORE to VS .NET than comes standard -- and if you're a customer now, you'll be upgrading for FREE. ;-)<br><br><br><br>Best regards,<br><br><br><br>David Stennett<br><br>JetBrains, Inc.</p>
