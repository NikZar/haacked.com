message: "<p>I installed Ubuntu 8.10 on a virtualbox and everything is fine, except for two things:<br>1.  it doesn't activate my printer, even though recognizing it.<br>2.  it also doesn't find my modem, which is a dial-up connection.<br>To resolve my dilemma, I am advised to use an HP printer and upgrade to Broadband by a person familiar with ubuntu systems.<br>Since I am financially restricted, my options are limited accordingly and therefore I would like to find a way to make things work with what I've got. Is that possible and, if so, how?<br>P.S.: The host system is Vista Home Premium, 32 bit.</p>"
