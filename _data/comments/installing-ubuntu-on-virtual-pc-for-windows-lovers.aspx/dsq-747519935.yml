message: <p>You were talking about the sudo-command, most system-files need you to be super-user(aka root), in order to be able to write the changes to the file.<br>In Ubuntu su-program is not used by default, I prefer to use that when changing something like this. It actually logs you in as super-user instead of executing one command.<br>Ps. My first post ;)</p>
