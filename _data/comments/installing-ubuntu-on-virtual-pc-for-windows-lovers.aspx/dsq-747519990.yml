message: <p>VPC '07 will install Ubuntu 8.10 but you still need to use the Safe Graphics Mode (F4 at title screen) and no mouse bugs.  Even more entertaining is when I installed VPC it said it wouldn't work with my current OS (Vista Home Prem.) but it seems to operate just fine, and only minimal lag while running Aero... not too shabby.  <br>I also run 2 monitors and set VPC to start in fullscreen on my 2nd monitor.</p>
