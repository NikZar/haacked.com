message: <p>Why am I not surprised? "Linux has solved all those install issues now, it's easier than windows!" Well no. In a very common environment for testing new software, neither the mouse nor graphics work. Humorously, you end up having to edit your x config, just like in the stereotypical Linux problems from history. <br>None of the other OSes I tried had any issue and worked out of the box with graphics and mouse - XP, 2K, NT4, OS/2, eCS, Win98.<br>Failed! Same as always.<br></p>
