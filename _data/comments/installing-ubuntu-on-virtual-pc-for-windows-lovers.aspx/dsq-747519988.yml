message: <p>Seems all good...but the download links are broken.<br>I'd like to see Virtual PC for myself as I have never used it before and need it. Restarting to switch OSes between WinXP and Ubuntu just sucks!<br>[p.s. I don't know you, you don't know me and so on but I googled Virtual PC (thank god for google!) and found this page, followed links , were aparently broken and left this comment.] ;-)</p>
