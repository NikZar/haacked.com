message: <p>I am sure you will have a great time in Brazil :) The .NET community here is huge and very enthusiastic. Besides churrasco, don't miss the "p√£o de queijo" (cheese bread), it's a delicious snack.<br>Try to find some time and visit the litoral as well! I recommend Florianopolis, halfway between B.A. and S.P., awesome city and beaches.<br></p>
