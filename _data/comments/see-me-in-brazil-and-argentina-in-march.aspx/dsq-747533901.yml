message: <p>Very cool to see Microsoft events down here in South America :D<br>I will try to attend it for sure. Sure there are a lot of things to see here and an year wouldn't be enough to see everything that is cool :)<br>Meanwhile, I would definitely recommend asking for a 'Picanha' in the churrascaria, trying to see the shore (Florianopolis is amazing), etc.<br>Looking forward to seeing you guys around here :)<br>Cheers,<br>Felipe</p>
