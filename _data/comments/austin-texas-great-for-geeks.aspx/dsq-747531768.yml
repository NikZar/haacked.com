message: <p>Sounds like a great community there!<br>Interesting that Dell is hiring so many <a href="http://asp.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="asp.net">asp.net</a> positions. I am curious about what it's like to work there. Are there any <a href="http://asp.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="asp.net">asp.net</a> bloggers who work at Dell?</p>
