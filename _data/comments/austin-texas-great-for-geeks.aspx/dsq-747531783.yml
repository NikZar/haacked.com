message: <p>This is a great post Phil.  I had a really good friend (excellent graphic designer) just move from Chicago to Austin for just that...to work for Dell.  In fact he just started this week.<br>Austin is very attractive for many reasons.  Would like to get my family to move there as well as myself but that's a whole other challenge.</p>
