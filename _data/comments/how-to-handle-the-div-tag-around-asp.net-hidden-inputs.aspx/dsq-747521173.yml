message: <p>Descriptive huh? Doesn't read that way to me. Phrases like "could have been implemented in a better manner" are loaded. In my first reading, I thought you were arguing in favor of such practices and assigning blame to ASP.Net. I just reread your post again and came away with the same impression. If you're simply trying to provide a work around, then that is not clear to me from what you've written here.</p>
