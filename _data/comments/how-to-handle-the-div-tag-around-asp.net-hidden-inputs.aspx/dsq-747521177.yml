message: <p>My point is that your intent did not match your language. You intended to describe an issue, but because of the loaded language, I misinterpreted. Perhaps I'm just being pedantic.<br>In any case, we disagree on at least one detail. I think that libraries and IDEs should be free to inject semantically neutral tags (div and span). I do not fault ASP.Net for this.</p>
