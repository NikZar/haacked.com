message: <p>After reading the announcement explaining the background of this renaming snafu, I suggest you simply revert back to the original name "NPack". It's simple and consistent with the NWhatever thing you've got going on, and it makes sense given it's a packaging system. What could be more perfect? <br>NPack, NPack, NPack.<br>You had it right the first time. You know you did.<br></p>
