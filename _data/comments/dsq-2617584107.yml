message: <p>Very insightful, although I would say that the usefulness of interview tests and questions depends on the quality and predicting power of those same tests and questions. Obviously some are stupid and have no business in the interview process. But there are <a href="https://www.testdome.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.testdome.com/">coding tests and challenges</a> that are well crafted and ask candidates to demonstrate specific abilities they'd need to use on the job. Trial projects can do this as well.</p>
