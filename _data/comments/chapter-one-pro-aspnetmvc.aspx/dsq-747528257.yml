message: <p>I'm unable to create a dinner.  It keeps saying "A value is required" but it doesn't tell me what field or value it needs (all fields are filled in).  The feedback window frequently won't display.  The Uservoice feedback page crashed.  The "Description" window shown when creating a dinner is far too small.  This is a nice idea for a site, but why did you release it with so many bugs?</p>
