message: <p>&gt; the book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution No Derivatives license<br>urm.. dont you mean the 'chapter' is licensed under CC?<br>trying to read it on my Kindle2 but theres a damn CC licence message on every page which gets in the middle of the text and makes it hard to read. otherwise great to have such a long chapter available for free. thansk!</p>
