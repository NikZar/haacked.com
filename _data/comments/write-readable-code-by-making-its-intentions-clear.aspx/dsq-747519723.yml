message: <p>I know that everyone in the blogosphere is saying this but...<br>* Explicitly naming variables, members, etc.<br>* Single Responsibility Principle<br>Of course, there are lots of little things, but those two are foremost in my mind lately.  <br>I've been writing a rather complex ActionScript (Flash) app the last few months and I keep asking myself, "How will a developer who comes after me understand this code?" Unfortunately, there's not a comparable ReSharper tool for ActionScript, as readability is often a product of refactoring.</p>
