message: <p>I second the call for Umbraco.. its open source (just 3% donation for commercial projects to keep the project developing), extremely flexible (definitely targeted towards developers who wish to extend the sytem, and make it work to their needs), and as NH mentioned, an active and friendly developer community.<br>Check it out - <a href="http://www.umbraco.org" rel="nofollow noopener" title="www.umbraco.org">www.umbraco.org</a></p>
