message: <p>The system that was explained to me paid all employees the same fixed percentage of company profit. This goes along with the Deming philosophy that 85% of the output of your employees can be attributed to the system they work in, with only 15% attributed to individual performance. This also prevents chasing high ratings during reviews like you mentioned.</p>
