message: <p>@Simone<br>that's partially true, you can use lighthouse (issue/project tracker) for free as long as its an opensource project and use git's hooks to do a mailing list if you really wanted to.  I think what git seems to lack unless i've missed something is a way to present downloads like for installers or builds.  <br>but you can also use git with google code by using git svn.</p>
