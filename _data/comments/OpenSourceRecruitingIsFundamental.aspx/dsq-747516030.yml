message: <p>I think the problem is a broader one of overall communication.  In NDoc's case, this was certainly a problem- would be donaters of time and money didn't know if the app was under development unless they scoured blogs for a second-hand email from Kevin.  But a cursory glance at open source projects shows that the successful ones are good at communicating their status and needs.  Even bad news, they report early and often.  This seems to go along with the spirit- open source includes open communication.</p>
