message: "<p><b>@Carlos</b>: In my experience the best way to get involved with an OS project/community is to find a bug/feature that is close to your heart, and just go after it. As a matter of fact, that is how I first got involved with the dotTEXT (and later subTEXT) community/project(s). <br>As for your concern about being <i>scorned</i> by the community... I have found this to be the exception rather than the rule. In general (or at least with the projects with which I've been involoved) the community is all too excited/happy to have others showing interest in and contributing to the project.<br>So in the case that your code isn't quite up to snuff, it is typically advice, constructive criticism, and/or an open discussion about other approaches to the solution - rather than scorn - that you'll get. And often times you walk away having learned something.<br>To be honest, in looking back at my <a href=\"http://stevenharman.net/blog/archive/2005/01/10/167.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://stevenharman.net/blog/archive/2005/01/10/167.aspx\">first public fix</a> for the dotTEXT blogging engine, I realize now that it was REALLY ugly. But it was a fix and a foot in the door none the less.<br>So I say, cast those fears aside and <b>get involved</b> my friend! Good Luck!</p>"
