message: <p>The Greeks recognized women philosophers. Diogenes includes over 50 of them in his Lives of the Philosophers but few intro courses cover any of these women.  Some were doing philosophy BEFORE Pythagoras<br>was born.<br>So I have started a web site - about 120 women included so far.<br><a href="http://www.women-philosophers.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="www.women-philosophers.com">www.women-philosophers.com</a> ....bet there are some you never heard of before.<br><br></p>
