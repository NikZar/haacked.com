message: <p>Dear Phil, <br>I find many big enterprises admins apply this technique of promoting and demoting normal user to admin group,during some software installation, but there is down side of it. <br>It makes non admin user temporarily admin, which make security hole, now user can do anything like creating new local admin on that machine and letter use it as he want :) <br>But any on personal machine this is very useful and secure technique. <br>Thanks <br>Dhananjay <br></p>
