message: "<p>PHP: none is there because it takes you to <a href=\"http://php.net\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"php.net\">php.net</a> . Php has by far the best reference website in <a href=\"http://php.net\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"php.net\">php.net</a>. This is probably why you don't see many searches on the php language constructs. Although I would venture to say that php user base has many novice programmers. <br>Personally I prefer Python. <br>So I guess in order to be able to determine maturity of the language we first have to know how a particular book or a popular website for a given language addresses all the questions a new programmer may have.</p>"
