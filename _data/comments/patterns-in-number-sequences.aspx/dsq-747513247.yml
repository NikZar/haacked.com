message: <p>What's up all...<br>     I have a number sequence I've been challenged to crack.  I have hit a block and was hoping that someone here might be able to help me.<br>Here is the sequence given me:1, 2, 3, 10,...(What are the next 2?)<br>     I get the feeling that I have simply overlooked something rather obvious, but I fail to notice the pattern here.  If anybody can identify this off the top of their head, I'd appreciate the help.<br>     Thanks in advance!</p>
