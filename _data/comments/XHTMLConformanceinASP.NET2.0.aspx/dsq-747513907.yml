message: "<p>Klevo, thanks for the URL.  I'm printing it now.  I added overflow:auto to the comments which should handle long urls a little better now.<br><br><br><br>Jayson, it turns out that named anchors are case sensitive.  So I need to change the links to use #feedback and not #FeedBack.  Doh!</p>"
