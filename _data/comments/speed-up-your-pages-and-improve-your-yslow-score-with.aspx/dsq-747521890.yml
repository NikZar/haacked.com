message: <p>Funny, but I as type this is your site is at least 10 times slower than it used to be. Maybe it's just lack of proper DNS propagation for now. I see a lot of "looking up <a href="http://haacked.com.nyud.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="haacked.com.nyud.net">haacked.com.nyud.net</a>" on my browser's status bar.</p>
