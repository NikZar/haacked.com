message: <p>Well it sure ain't GotDotNet.  I think SourceForge does a fine job for a FREE hosted CVS platform. You don't have to host your website files there (but if you wanted to, I showed you how).<br><br><br><br>However, if you can spend money on your own source control hosting, you might consider using trac (<a href="http://www.edgewall.com/trac/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.edgewall.com/trac/">http://www.edgewall.com/trac/</a>) and subversion.</p>
