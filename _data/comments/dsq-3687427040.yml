message: <p>Love this sentiment in every way. Having that broader lens means that you see beyond the small handful of valley unicorns and that the vast majority of impactful technology work happens literally everywhere else. I'm proud to work for a small startup in Orlando, and I know we're changing lives with our product. I don't need mystical credibility to feel good about the work.</p>
