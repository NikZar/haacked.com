message: <p>Since Code Lives Forever on the net, I'll make one more niggly suggestion (boy, everyone's a critic, aren't they). Having the delimiter passed in as a string rather than a char (as it is in String.Join) would make the function a little more flexible. <br>For example, I've had need in the past to specify ",&lt;space&gt;" as the delimiter for a list of things presented in a UI.<br></p>
