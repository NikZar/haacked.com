message: '<p>Not a comment, just a question:  Could this process be used to convert strings of data from cell phone text messages into delimited strings?  Like, say a customer texting a specific pizza order (pan crust extra cheese pepperoni family size) to a pizza shop?  Or a taxpayer texting his tax payment to a government office (bank routing number, account number, amount of payment)?</p>'
