message: <p><br>Recursion is a totally different method of solving problems. Conventional problem solving methods consists of decomposing the solution into steps, and executing each step in turn. Well…enter recursion. The recursive way of solving a problem is to reduce the problem into another problem that is exactly of the same type, and solving the new one instead. And how do you solve the new one? Guess what? You just reduce it into another problem of exactly the same type, and so on, and so on, and so on…<br>Ok, before it gets too weird, let's see an example of a real-life problem, and how we can use recursion to solve it.<br><br></p>
