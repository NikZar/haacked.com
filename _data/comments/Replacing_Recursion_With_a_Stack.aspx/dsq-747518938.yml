message: <p>Great example Phil.  When I read that comment on recursion in Jeff's post, I thought back to the my last use of recursion in the real world and it was, in fact, this exact situation with <a href="http://asp.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="asp.net">asp.net</a>. Thanks for providing the non-recursive solution to this problem.<br></p>
