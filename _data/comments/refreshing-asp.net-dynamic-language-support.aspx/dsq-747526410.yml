message: <p>I've been search google high and low for guidance on how to use IronPython with tight integration into .net libraries.  The one large snag I keep seeing over and over is not being able to use Attributes (System.Attribute) which would prevent key functionality from being specified/injected.  Can anyone tell show me if there is a way to get around this.  Even a link would be helpful.<br>Thanks</p>
