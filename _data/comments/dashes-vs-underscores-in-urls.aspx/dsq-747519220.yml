message: <p>Who cares?<br>As a human, it doesn't really matter.  Yes, there are some points about readability vs. typeability vs. recognizability.  As long as I can recognize the url as a url, I'm good.  I can always cut/paste, click on a link, etc.<br>As a search engine, this should absolutely not matter.  If a search engine is relying on a url to give a page relevance (even if the contribution percentage is small), then I would say that relevance calculation is broken.  Content matters, not the url.  <br></p>
