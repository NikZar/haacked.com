message: "<p><strong>It's capitalism baby!</strong><br>To put in another way: duplication of efforts is good, and competition is good. It allows new thing to grow, and also grow better. It also allows other men to make money from their work. It also allows other men to make stupid choices, if they want to. It's them that are going to pay for those choices in any case.<br></p>"
