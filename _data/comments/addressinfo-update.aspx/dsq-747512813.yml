message: "<p>Phil,<br><br><br><br>Since you've done this for states, I have a new challenge for you:  try writing a similar code for 2 and 3 character country ISO codes.  I don't think you could really sell it, but I know anyone who works in international corporations would be extremely thankful.  If that's too easy for you, try writing code to convert international currency codes into the full currency name.  An example, ZAR is South African Rand.</p>"
