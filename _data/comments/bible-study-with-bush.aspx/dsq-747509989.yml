message: <p>Okay, I'll bite...<br><br><br><br>Assuming GWB is a Protestant Christian rather than a follower of Judaism, none of these things really apply here. That's why you don't see Baptists saccrificing bulls and what not. These are all quotes from Judaic law, which was (according to common Protestant teaching) fulfilled by the New Testament of the Bible. You know, all that Jesus stuff:<br><br><br><br>Galatians 2:16<br><br>...know that a man is not justified by observing the law, but by faith in Jesus Christ. So we, too, have put our faith in Christ Jesus that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by observing the law, because by observing the law no one will be justified.</p>
