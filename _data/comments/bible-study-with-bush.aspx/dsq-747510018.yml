message: <p>I've come across the original letter before and think it's profound, not only about gay marriages (which i fully support- After all, people of the early 1900's were known for suppressing black rights- do we want to be known for suppressing the rights of gay people?) but against the radicals who (quite wrongly) uphold that inter-racial relationships are sinful. I think many people need to read this letter- I'm not saying you should neccessarily agree with everything it's implying but hey, once a mind is expanded, it never goes back to the original size. Peace. ~*Laura</p>
