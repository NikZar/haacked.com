message: <p>Any claims that quoting a section of a text 'out of context' or 'without reference to the whole story' makes said claims wrong is bizarre.  It may be a stretch, but in the end that just means I have to quote the whole bible in order to make any argument doesn't it?  I mean really the appropriate thing would be an awareness of what else is said in a passage or paragraph.  Not that I know anything about the Bible.  But then again to quote a local comedian, I'm Jewish and I love the first episode but I wouldn't touch the sequel.</p>
