message: <p>Thanks all! I updated the post with a big mea culpa. Yep, it's because the SELECT tag is not closed and the DOCTYPE wasn't specified. I included a link to an example with corrected HTML and it indeed does work correctly.<br>So consider this a bug with my HTML and not with the browsers. :)</p>
