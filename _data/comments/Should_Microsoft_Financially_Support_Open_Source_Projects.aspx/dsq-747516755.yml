message: <p>I think sometime an open source project can have the effect of acting like a grass roots campaign to cause Microsoft to adopt new technology.  The example I am thinking of is NUnit and how it seems it drove Microsoft to buy into unit testing/TDD and include it in VS.Net.  Not sure Microsoft always thinks to support this if (at least in a way) is a move to change their way of thinking.</p>
