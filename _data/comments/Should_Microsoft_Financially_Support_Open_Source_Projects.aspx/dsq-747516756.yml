message: <p>Well I feel Microsoft should support Open source progect Financially. But againg if they start supporting many open source project it will be more of burden for them (also financially). SO I feel Microsoft should support Open Source Project selectively. The projects like dotnetnuke and NDoc should be supported by Microsoft.</p>
