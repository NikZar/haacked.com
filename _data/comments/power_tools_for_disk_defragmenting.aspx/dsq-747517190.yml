message: <p>Excellent! I ran a regular windows defrag last night, and was left with 29 files - a total of 36GB and ~100,000 file fragments that the defragger wouldn't touch. Even after it ran, it still recommended I defrag. How useless can something be?  It took some time, but I contig'd each of the files that couldn't be defragged (sadly they were spread all over the disk, several different file types), then ran the regular defrag again and now its actually making some progress.  thanks for the link, that's a drive saver :)</p>
