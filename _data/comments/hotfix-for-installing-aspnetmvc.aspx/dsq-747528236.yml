message: '<p>This hotfix never finished installing and put my machine in a perpetual restart.  It will restart show configuring updates: stage 3 of 3 and when it gets to 100% is says shutting down.  I have gone through this routine about 10 times so far.  I cannot even start in safe mode. When trying to start in safe mode it immediately says "shutting down".  I need help ASAP!</p>'
