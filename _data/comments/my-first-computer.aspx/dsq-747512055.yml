message: <p>My first computer was a TI1000 -- it drove the graphics to my 9-inch B&amp;W "monitor" using the 3.58MHz Z80 CPU, meaning little was left for actual CPU use. I graduated to a VIC20, a CBM64, then my first "real" computer, an Amiga 500. Stuck with Amiga until their demise with my heavily non-stock Amiga 1200 and then switched to Mac. Avoided using Windows until the XP era.<br>Anyone who says that their first computer was an XT or higher, or complains about the tiny 20MB hard drive they had to suffer with, looses extreme geek cred. Seriously.</p>
