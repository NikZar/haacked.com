message: <p>My first computer in 1979 was an Alpha Micro, it ran on an S100 bus. In 1981 I got an IBM PC soon followed by a PC-XT. I currently have 20 IBM PC's made between 1981 and 1985, Classic PC, XT, AT, Portable and Convertble. They all work! I learned to program in C using Borland Turbo C on a PC-XT. When I write C code today I do it on my XT using Turbo-C then port it to a more modern C compiler.</p>
