message: <p>My fist was a CoCo just like the gray beauty shown in the post.  My sister and I would take turns dictating lines of code from a magazine to get really "fun" games to do things like guess random numbers.<br>My dad bought us a chess game, but we had to return it to Radio Shack.  We had the CoCo connected to a B&amp;W TV (remember them?) and you couldn't tell which pieces were which!<br>My parents made a lot of financial sacrifices to get me into computers as a kid.  Now I write software for medical devices.  I will always be grateful for their gifts of computer "toys."</p>
