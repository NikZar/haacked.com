message: <p>Ahhhh... a Timex Sinclair 1000. (Circa 1983?) That thing had a whopping 4K of RAM and a membrane keyboard that stuck very often... It loaded saved programs from tape, and maybe my player was too old, but it hardly ever worked... But I learned to program (BASIC) on it, and 25+ years later, here I am making a living at it... Those were the Good ole' days...</p>
