message: <p>My first computer was dial-up terminal that printed on thermal paper. My dad worked for Xerox in Texas and would bring it home occasionally. You could play Chess, Zork, or Star Trek. Second computer was a Timex Sinclair and lasted about two days before I returned it. Then off to college with and Apple 2C, an Amiga 1000, and then finally a PC. It became obvious during College that the PC had taken over and thats what I would ultimately be working with. My favorite was the Amiga. It was so far ahead of its time and some would argue that it's still not obsolete.</p>
