message: <p>While in the starting of my blogging I never cared about the hosting companies but later I discovered that if one day I got minor problem no body will trace out it easily. So i moved to Hostgator now I daily take backup to my blog to remain safe. Mine blog is hosted on Linux servers and giving me good return.</p>
