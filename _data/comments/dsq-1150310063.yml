message: <p>I hope we can work together again in the future too!</p><p>By day I'm leading the web/backend development efforts at <a href="http://bignerdranch.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://bignerdranch.com">http://bignerdranch.com</a> - primarily using Ruby, but Python, Go, Javascript/Node, etc., are all becoming more prevalent too. I occasionally find a few free hours to hack on a side project, <a href="http://brewdega.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://brewdega.com">http://brewdega.com</a>... if only I had a month of Sundays.</p><p>And yes, I do still blog - on rare occasion - at <a href="http://stevenharman.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://stevenharman.net">http://stevenharman.net</a>. Which is running Octopress on Heroku, as it turns out. :)</p>
