message: "<p>@Seth Petry-Johnson: I don't like code for presentation. I'd prefer a templating language that abstracts these things away. I also can't see why you'd send a null collection to some presentation code. You can fix that issue at the source and always assign the collection instead.<br>Null guards will quickly polute your code base. By accepting it a single place, you'll have to deal with it everywhere. You don't start receiving null arguments unless you at some point accepted it in the first place. Fail fast.</p>"
