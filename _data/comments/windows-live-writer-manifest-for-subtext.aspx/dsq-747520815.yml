message: <p>We didn't/don't have anything formal in place, basically just off-the-cuff conversations between our developers and whomever they happened to run across. It's pretty clear to us now that we need to be more intentional in the way we communicate with server implementers as a community.<br>Thanks for reaching out. We forwarding to working with you in the future!</p>
