message: <p>I know this comment is 13 years old but ... "frequency domains"? That terminology is twisted from its real meaning, which doesn't apply here anyway (or were you thinking of <a href="http://www.hertz.com?);" rel="nofollow noopener" title="www.hertz.com?);">www.hertz.com?);</a> just as "impedance mismatch" was a ridiculous analogy when Grady Booch used it in the first place.  The phenomenon that he was trying to describe was simple enough to understand; the obscure analogy made it more confusing, not less</p>
