message: <p>A DC situation like this isn't really where you normally talk about 'impedance mismatches'.<br><br><br><br>The situations where 'impedance mismatches' are usually used are in situations with changing signals. For example, if you have a digital signal, with the voltage changing suddenly from 0V to 3V, if the wire carrying that signal has a sudden change in impedance, you tend to get reflections bouncing back down the wire.<br><br><br><br>So if there's an impedance mismatch, signals get messed up as they cross the mismatched boundary. I think this situation is somewhat closer in spirit to the way that 'impedance mismatch' is used in O/R mapping examples.</p>
