message: <p>There's a really loud crazy place on Olympic called Manna.  This has all you can eat meat for approx. $17 and the quality of the meat is comparable to other Korean BBQ places in LA.  You'll stink like smoke afterwards but if you have friends who are bottomless pits, this is the place to go.</p>
