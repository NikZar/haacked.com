message: <p>Went to BCD Tofu House (Wilshire and Kingsley) last night after a concert.  The restaurant's ambience is ok, food selection's good, and the price is just right for a decent kalbi with tofu soup.  It's not top-notch quality but definitely a contender among korean restaurants in Los Angeles.  Highly Recommended.</p>
