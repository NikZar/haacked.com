message: <p>Ruby doesn't support attributes, but there are certainly alternative ways to representing filters.  For example in rails you do:<br>before_filter :require_authentication, :on =&gt; :show<br>I think perhaps something similar could be done <a href="http://asp.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="asp.net">asp.net</a> mvc, which could either decorate the appropriate methods with the attributes or set up an interceptor on the appropriate method calls.</p>
