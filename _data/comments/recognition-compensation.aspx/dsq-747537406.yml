message: <p>I kind of lost all respect for the program when my senior developer made his 5 year old son an MVP in a few months of trolling forums and re-posting answers. There are so many posts that are cut and paste copies of others work, and cross posting to dozens of sites its silly... Maybe regional reps should get more involved in the community and award it personally.</p>
