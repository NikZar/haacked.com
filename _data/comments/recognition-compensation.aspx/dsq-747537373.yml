message: <p>I kinda think that even if some people are doing it for the 'wrong' reasons its still beneficial to the community. I kinda dont see the MVP system as a recognition system but rather a reward system for community contribution. No one reason is ever going to be the driver for people to contribute online. Some people will do it for the reputation, some for kicks, some to improve their CV ect.<br>For Microsoft to offer MVP as another driver for community contribution is great as overall it will make the community a richer place. <br>I suppose my point is that if you look at MVP as a recognition system it perhaps isn't particularly fair or reasonable, but I reality its more of a reward system which perhaps doesn't need to be as fair or reasonable.</p>
