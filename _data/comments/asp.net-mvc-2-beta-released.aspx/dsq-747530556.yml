message: <p>My site uses $.getJSON() which returns a json array.  There is no equivalent $post version of this that I'm aware of.  So as a result my site couldn't work without setting JsonRequestBehavior.AllowGet which means my code is still vulnerable.  Are there any suggestions as to how to handle this?</p>
