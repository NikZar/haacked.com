message: <p>Phil, I do think it's unjust that the early adopter, that do so much for the community by trying beta/ ctp software, have once again been left out in the cold. I'm of course referring to the lack of support for VS2010 - for every comment left on your blog about the the lack of support, you must assume that there are hundreds/ thousands more who haven't replied that have the same issues.<br>Is there nothing us VS2010'ers can do to get the beta playing nicely?? ...even an unofficial nudge in the right direction...</p>
