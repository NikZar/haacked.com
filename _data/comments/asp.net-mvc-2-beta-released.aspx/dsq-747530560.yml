message: <p>I'm also confused as to what is the way go regarding Area support. I'm having the same problem as @Yitzhak, It would be good to know if the multi-project support for area registration is/will be dropped.<br>BTW, the Add area dialog is great.<br>Thanks Phil and all the MVC team for the great work! Really appreciated.<br>Felipe</p>
