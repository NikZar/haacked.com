message: <p>Interesting.  See that's exactly the scenario where I think this app block could be useful. It's those cases where you have multi-step scenarios where each step is based on the current state of the app.<br><br><br><br>I have a lot of code that does a switch statement saying if the state is this, do that.  I'd essentially like that switch statement to be in an XML file so it's more declarative.</p>
