message: <p>Overkill? Obtuse certainly.<br>I agree with Scott H that it's probably all unnecessary, leave it to javascript; however, if you really want to do it, why is the mvc implementation better than simply using an if statement?<br>Why is this better than:<br>&lt;% foreach ... {<br>   if IsAlt { %&gt;<br>...<br>&lt;% } else { %&gt;<br>...<br>&lt;% }<br>} %&gt;<br>MVC seems to be forgetting to KISS...</p>
