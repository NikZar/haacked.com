message: <p>Wow! I love what Scott has proposed. This way, we only loop over items (without bothering to find alternating rows and adding a different class to them), then in client-side, we find those rows easily using jQuery. That rocks man! I love you Haccked. This post saved me from hours of vain search.</p>
