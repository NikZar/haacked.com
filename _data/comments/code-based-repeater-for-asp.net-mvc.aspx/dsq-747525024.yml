message: <p>I love it.  Something as simple as a reapeater and we have 30 different methods to achieve the same thing.  Definitely what I want my devs spending their time working on.  I guess spending time on solving actual business problems is so yesterday, now devs will get to spend time learning how to rebuild basic server controls.</p>
