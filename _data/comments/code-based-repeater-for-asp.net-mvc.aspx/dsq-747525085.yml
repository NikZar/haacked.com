message: <p>Same question as a couple other people, is this helper usable with the Razor engine?  I've been having problems w/ the syntax of it if it is.  If not is it possible to make a declarative helper in Razor where you pass it a generic list and the html code it will repeat?<br>Thanks,<br>Sean</p>
