message: <p>Ha...  that's a nuthin oops.<br>I brought down a 1200+ person network for 45 minutes once.  I gotta say though, I think it was probably less expensive than yours.  But only less expensive because it was at a Government Base, thus no one was really doing anything anyway.  :o<br>(j/k - I know some of you Guv'ment types work hard out there)</p>
