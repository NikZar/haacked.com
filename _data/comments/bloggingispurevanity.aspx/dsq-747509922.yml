message: <p>I've always thought blogging was the product of excessive self-indulgence. When one of my particularly vain coworkers started a particularly insipid blog, it was time to strike back. So I started blogging the news of his life. Then I told everyone else at work about it except him. He still doesn't know about it and we've been laughing at him for a week now.</p>
