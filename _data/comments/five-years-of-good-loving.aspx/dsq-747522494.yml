message: <p>Yes,<br>I have an Iranian friend in TX and he told me some stories about INS employees.  Unfortunately they just tried to erase the problem rather than solving it!  At that time, I can remember that they began many many stupid programs not only inside US but also in several other countries (especially in Middle Earth) in order to stop terrorism!!</p>
