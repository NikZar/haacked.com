message: <p>Now that we all know that our account has been hacked and being misused, Yahoo should help us in getting our account back with any proof we have that proves our ownership of account. If they will ask predefined questions like date of birth, pin code etc etc and insist  on their exact match, they are doing nothing but help the hackers.</p>
