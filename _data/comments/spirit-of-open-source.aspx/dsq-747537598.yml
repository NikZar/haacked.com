message: <p>Personally it has always struck me that the biggest annoyance around the way that MVC is developed is not being able to see the ongoing commits.  The taking of outside contribution is purely secondary for me.  But on that topic, I would love to hear your perspective (given your former position on the team) on why outside contribution is not taken.  It seems that the benefits would far outweigh the cost. <br>All that said, having access to the MVC source has been a huge boon to me both as a learning tool and for the ability to go just a bit deeper in a tough debug situation.  It is a great step in openness for Microsoft and I think it will cause many other companies to open further.</p>
