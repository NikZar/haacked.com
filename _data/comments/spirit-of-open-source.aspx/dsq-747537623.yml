message: <p>Thanks for posting this Phil! I am so tired of people saying a project that shares it's source under a proper license is not OSS. It's good to see some clarification.<br>Don't get me wrong, take backs / accepting patches are awesome and i am a huge supporter of that if ti makes sense.</p>
