message: <p>This is awesome!  I'd like to use this on a webform I'm creating -- how hard would it be to convert this so that the highlighting happens when a form field within a row is clicked instead?  I don't have a huge amount of programming background, so if you have an example, it would be greatly appreciated!<br>Many thanks,<br>Josh</p>
