message: <p>HA! I actually expected the output of "Alias" only.  Only because in a former life, I used a lot of Reflection and wrote my own reflection library because the one in .Net 1.0 sucked.  BUT... I had no idea that was the reason why.  Guess it makes sense that interface inheritance doesn't require a single inheritance tree.<br>Thanks for this post.</p>
