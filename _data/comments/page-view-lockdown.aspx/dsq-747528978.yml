message: <p>Stupid question... Why can't we specify multiple 'PageParseFilter's and have them co-operate with each other on the "Least permissive" set of results? Why can't 'MyPageParserFilter' co-exist with 'ViewTypeParserFilter'? It looks like if one returs NumberOfControlsAllowed of 5 and another 4 then the obvious result would be 4. AllowControl true and false would be false. Etc.</p>
