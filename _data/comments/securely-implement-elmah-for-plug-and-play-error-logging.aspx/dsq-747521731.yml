message: <p>Scott, you don't need to create a physical directory named "Admin". <br>The HttpHandler will look for requests to "/admin/elmah.axd" and handle those requests.<br>Keep in mind that elmah.axd doesn't physically exist either. The handler declaration indicates that the class <code>Elmah.ErrorLogPageFactory</code> implements <code>IHttpHandler</code> and will thus handle those requests.</p>
