message: <p>I would like to point out that code changes are SOMETIMES required to make ELMAH work. For example, the GlobalErrorHandler class was not logging my exceptions in ELMAH. I had to explicitly write one line of code in my GlobalErrorHandler.cs to make it work:</p><p>Elmah.ErrorSignal.FromCurrentContext().Raise(ex);</p>
