message: <p>Since you do not know which child will end up being the ruler of the world, and which will end up being the mad, scheming, sycophant   who usurp the throne given the first opportunity, it is best to treat them both the same in the hope that, one day, when you are confined to a tower for the remainder of your life, which ever one is currently in control, will think on you fondly -- or at least recall that you always treated them fairly -- and allow you Internet access and a perhaps a view of the ocean. <br>...This message sent from my tower suite.</p>
