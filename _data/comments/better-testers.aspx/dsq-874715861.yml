message: <p>I guess I have been lucky. In both companies that I have worked for with testers, neither considered that an entry to programming. Both looked for some experience in the industry served. My only issue is that I wished we had more developer support for the tester. I believe it would be good to develop a test to replicate every bug found. Then that be tested without a human giving them more time to find new bugs.</p>
