I just happened to download it in the small window where they had accidentally left some debug code in there.<br><br><br><br>It wasn't even their main product.  It's a provider to enable the main rich text editor work in DotNetNuke.  I don't want to name names, but it's a totally RAD text editor.  ;)</p>
