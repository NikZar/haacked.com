message: <p>See, now this isn't drivel. :-) I totally agree with you on this. If you're going to bother writing something and selling it, at least go all the way and test it a little on things that aren't your customer's machines. Instant buyer's remorse is achieved when the product just doesn't work out of the box, especially when the demo version worked great.<br><br><br><br>You should actually mention the product you're fighting with, so the rest of us know to look out for it.</p>
