message: "<p>\"&gt; Another point: In math you can define whatever axioms you want, but if they contradict the physical laws in our universe then they are pretty useless (only of theoretical value).</p><p>I agree with the first part, but disagree with the second part. Much of mathematics has no analog to the physical world but it doesn't necessarily make it useless. Sometimes the techniques employed to arrive at results are interesting and useful.\"</p><p>The only time those techniques themselves are useful though is if there is an equation derived from observation and from nature which requires them. For example, you would make the argument that the mathematical study of ordinary differential equations is only theoretical, but the techniques we learn from the study are categorized as useful. However, they only are categorized as such because we use them outside of pure mathematics. There is nothing in mathematics that is used ONLY in pure mathematics that is ever classified as \"useful\" by more than a few people.</p>"
