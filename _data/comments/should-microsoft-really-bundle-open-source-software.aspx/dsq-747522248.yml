message: <p>I have to side with Ayende here. The fear factor is total FUD. You may be too young to remember, but Microsoft has integrated open source code into their software before. They integrated code from the open source BSD TCP/IP stack into Windows NT way back in the day. The NT license info even gave credit where credit was due, as required by the BSD license. As the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_NT" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_NT">Wikipedia says</a>, "...Microsoft would implement a TCP/IP stack derived from the BSD Unix stack."</p>
