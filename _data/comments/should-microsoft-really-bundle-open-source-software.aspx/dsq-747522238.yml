message: <p>@Tom Pollard - Do you have references for which portions of Mac OS X is open source? I'd be curious to look at the parallels there. Maybe MS has something to learn from their experience. Then again, maybe it's just a matter of time before Apple gets sued. ;)<br>Regarding the OSS projects that Apple included, I wonder if the software pedigree of the code was well documented via a process like the FSF requires for contributors.<br></p>
