Can ya believe it?<br><a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/opensource/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://developer.apple.com/opensource/index.html\">http://developer.apple.com/...</a><br>Not to mention Bonjour and WebKit. They also ship with GCC, Python, Ruby,Apache and starting with Leopard will include the Rails framework.<br>I think it's easier to ask: What software that ships with OS X ISN'T OSS. Basicaly Quartz and the iLife stuff. <br>re:Pedigree - well GCC is pretty well documented. :)<br></p>"
