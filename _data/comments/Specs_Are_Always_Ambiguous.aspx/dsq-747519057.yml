message: <p>Darren I agree (RE FizzBuzz) but Phil's point is so critically important for many reasons. Most of which is financial. Not knowing how to ask questions and dive deep on requirements takes more time and costs more money. While I'd like to make sure I never see FizzBuzz again, the issues it's raising are core to what we do (and why I think it's so popular).</p>
