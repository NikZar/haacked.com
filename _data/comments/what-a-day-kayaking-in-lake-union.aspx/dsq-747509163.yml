message: <p>We recently rented from the Paddle Club at the Aqua Verda Cafe.  We had a nice time on the water but the service at the Paddle Club was terrible.  the people were rude, and the owner Ray Lopez was the worst.  I would not recommend renting from the Paddle Club, we have plans to go again but we will not rent from them ever again.</p>
