message: "<p>So what you are saying is that looking at this code could expose you to a lawsuit from MS but that they didn't do it BECAUSE they wanted to sue. <br>That's a silly statement. Unless you were in the meeting room you have no idea why they did it. Imagine this scenario.<br>Employee: Hey boss if we made the source code available people could help up debug it for free.<br>Boss: Mmmm let me take it up at the next meeting.<br>Meeting: Not only would we have millions of people debug the code for us for free  but we could also hold this as a threat over people who want to switch to mono on linux. Let's do it.<br></p>"
