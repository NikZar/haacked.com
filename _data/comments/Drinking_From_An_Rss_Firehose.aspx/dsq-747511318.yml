message: <p>Hi, Phil.  Have you tried Findory (<a href="http://findory.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://findory.com">http://findory.com</a>)?  It's a personalized news aggregator designed to filter content based on your tastes and preferences.  Findory learns from the articles you read and builds a personalized front page.<br><br><br><br>Great point on allowing a little bit of noise through.  I'd put it slightly differently though.  I think the goal is to make the recommendations a little surprising.  They shouldn't be obvious.  They need to help you discover things you probably wouldn't have found on your own.</p>
