message: <p>I, like you, am getting slammed with comment spam. My personal feeling is you find the spammers and execute them on the spot. Luckily for the world, I am not in charge.<br>But the damndest thing is that most spam seems to be the leftovers from automated, virus type systems. I think most spammers come up with some viral program, unleash it, get a few thousand hits before someone figures it out and shuts them down. The viruses still spam away, but the links are busted or no longer make sense.<br>I still can't believe people actually think that they should click on a link selling "c!@l....i..s and cheeeep VI/a/r ga." but apparently, they do enough to justify some schmuck to pay for it.</p>
