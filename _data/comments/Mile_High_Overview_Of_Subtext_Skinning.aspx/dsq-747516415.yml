message: <p>I have heard about Subtext skinning from my friends, but have never tried it by myself. I have read this high level overview of how skinning works in Subtext and learned about it in detail. All the changes that to be made on each files are explained in details and so it is really easy to learn for even a beginner like me. As the path of the files to be edited are also provided, it is really simple for everyone and donâ€™t need to waste time trying to find where the files are located.</p>
