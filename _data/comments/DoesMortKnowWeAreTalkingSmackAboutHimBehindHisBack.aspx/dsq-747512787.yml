message: <p>Even a couple days later, I still can't believe that you wrote the great response while on vacation in Japan.  I agree with a lot of what you are saying here, but I've got to hold out hope that there has to be a way to develop better systems with a lot less work.  We can not continue developing systems at the current pace, and still get the jumps in efficiencies that drives the world economy.</p>
