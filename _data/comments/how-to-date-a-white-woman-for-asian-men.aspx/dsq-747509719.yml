message: <p>It shouldn't be titled "How to Date a White Woman"; instead, it should read "How to Date a White 'American' Woman".  Foreign women have always been nicer and more approachable than many of the hostile American women that I encounter on a daily basis.<br>This probably explains why JP (from the Phillipines) is dating the white woman from Belarus.  She's white, but she's not a stuck up white chick.  <br>It's not about color; it's about nationality.</p>
