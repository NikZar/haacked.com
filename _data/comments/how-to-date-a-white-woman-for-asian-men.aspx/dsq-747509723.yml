message: <p>I am a white girl who happens to finds most Asian men  far more attractive then the vast majority of white males. What I have found, though, is that the Asian men I have dated are much more subtle then their white counterparts and I always end up initiating things on the sexual front. Not that I mind but that is a difference I have noticed. Being from Europe , I also find that European men are way more sexual then white American males. I would say sexual in the seductive sense not in the getting wasted and banging sense.</p>
