message: <p>Hi Phil,<br>Thanks for sharing. I keep meaning to give Subsonic a try. My problem is that I am addicted to CodeSmith and you can still get ver 2.6 for free. I have a set of <a href="http://tod1d.net/files/folders/codesmith/entry13.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://tod1d.net/files/folders/codesmith/entry13.aspx">CodeSmith templates that I live by</a>. Similar to your Sonic solution, simply re-generate my code for specific tables whenever the meta data changes.</p>
