message: "<p>One year ago I was deciding if it was better to use DNN or Rainbow portal as CMS...<br>I installed both of them, and the I decided to go with DNN.. even if the rainbow portal has been started in Italy (and I'm italian :-)): it was much more complex to skin compared to DNN (or at least less easy to understand how to do it easily)...<br>And now I'm quite skilled in DNN... :-)<br>Once I was thinking on making SubText a DNN module... but the DNN module structure need most of the SubText code to be rewritten... so... I put that idea in the trashcan</p>"
