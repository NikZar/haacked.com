message: <p>Most of my team is local, however I have clients all over the world.  Sometimes I need to write an email at near midnight if I want to get a quick response; however I also have caught myself wanting to write that email, then save a draft and set a reminder to send it 8 hours later because I don't want to appear to be a night owl...<br>I've quickly come to realize though that it really doesn't matter when it's sent; my clients really don't care.  Neither does my team.</p>
