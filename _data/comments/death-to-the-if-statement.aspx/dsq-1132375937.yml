message: <p>Aside from the fact you should probably get more sleep, You've hit on what seems like the crux of the argument here:</p><p>Some people prefer readable code over efficient, some will prefer efficient code over readable.</p><p>That may be over simplifying though.  In reality I think context is the important thing to consider in choosing here.  If your code is on a hot path then you may need to have the less readable method, with the benefit of faster code.</p>
