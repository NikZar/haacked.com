message: <p>&gt; *false if the enumerator has passed the end of the collection*</p><p>I think his point refers to that "if" in that statement. For example, it does not say "false _WHEN_ the enumerator has passed the end of the collection".</p><p>It says "if". There's no requirement that an IEnumerable ever terminate.</p>
