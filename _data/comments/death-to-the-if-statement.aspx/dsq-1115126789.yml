message: <p>This example has nothing to do with "the death of if". The first code with "if" is just OK written code, as it is not optimal. If we compare OK code with GOOD code, then there always be a difference - both in performance and readability. I don't see a reason to encourage developers to think about "IF's", when they should be thinking about optimal execution.</p>
