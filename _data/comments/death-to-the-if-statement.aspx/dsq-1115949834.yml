message: <p>Right. Original implementation with the "if" is telling the computer what to do. The latter implementation is more about telling the computer what you want.</p><p>It's like the difference between "Go north 100 steps, Go east 50 steps, Go North another 100 steps." instead of "Go to the store." I prefer declarative code.</p>
