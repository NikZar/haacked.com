message: "<p>It's not quite the same. I'm thinking of the total # of ifs in a project. If I have one \"if\" per method, my cyclometric complexity will remain low, but I'll have a lot of ifs still. That's not as bad as having a bunch of methods with cyclometric complexity, but it still might indicate I need to try and be more declarative. :)</p>"
