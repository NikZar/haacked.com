message: <p>One interesting suggestion I heard is that "guidance" should be more centralized and driven by P&amp;P. Maybe they don't create ALL guidance, but they should be involved in all of it. They can provide the expertise to get community involved and to review samples, resource kits, etc...<br>What do you think?</p>
