message: <p>Keep Kobe, it's a great example of what a lot of production applications look like. Then release Kobe v2 and a series of articles detailing it's re-factoring to best practices.<br>Probably best to release a number of stages, possibly even get a number of community volunteers to take charge of each stage. Example:<br>v1.1 - Improved error handling (remove all the copy and paste code that exists currently) (DRY)<br>v1.2 - Improved data access<br>v1.3 - Reduced code complexity (Single Responsibility)<br>v1.4 - etc.....<br>v1.5 - etc....<br>Just a though.</p>
