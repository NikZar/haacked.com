message: <p>Can I put a vote in for NOT rushing to implement a review process so extreme that no one can be bothered to ever release anything like this again.<br>A bit of perspective about some of the criticism is needed - some very opinionated bloggers have written some very strong criticism based to a significant extent on a mixture of their own preferences and current fashions (which will be gone again in another couple of years).  Then dozens of sheep have piled in bleating enthusiastically and theatrically sheeshing and face-palming over utter trivia.<br>We cannot have it both ways folks - we can't have MVC or IronPython style fast release cycle and openness while looking for SQL Server perfection (hmmm).<br>The bazaar is noisy and stinks, and the cathedral is quiet and perfumed.  Half a dozen years ago there was much fashionable ranting and baa-ing on that subject too, and in case any of you can't remember, it was the bazaar that won.<br></p>
