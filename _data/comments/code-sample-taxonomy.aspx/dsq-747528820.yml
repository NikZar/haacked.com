message: <p>how about a website/app that allows you to upload your code samples for hosting; and from there you can reference them to appear inline within your blog post; samples would appear in a consistent way and could be marked as 'sample' or 'reference' etc. The community could discuss the sample techniques and vote on the production quality of the code; issue warnings; post ammendments; offer advice/links to how it would be better to do the dodgy bits that just exist to make the main point of the example easier to understand. You could score points (double points for being nerdy about microsoft posts); a bit like flickr but for code instead of pics.</p>
