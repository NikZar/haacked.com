message: <p>HOW I GOT MY WIFE BACK!!!</p><p>I have been married for 16 years, 3 kids, 2 dogs, great home - what I thought was the perfect life. Almost two years ago my wife came to me and told me she wanted a divorce. She "loved me but wasn't in love with me anymore", was how she put it. She had been going to a therapist for over a year who had encouraged her to "find herself", "make herself happy". Never mind her husband and her children. I agreed to go to counseling sessions with her therapist. The counselor wanted us to explore our past and express our anger at each other. With each session our marriage got worse. I begged my wife to stay in the marriage and keep trying to make it work, not just for us, but for the children. She refused. She said it was over.</p><p>I was reading a web site. I read that there was a man who can help me get my wife back... his name was called "Dr Malaa". I read of his good works from cover to cover several times. I immediately stopped chasing and begging my wife to return. i cyontacted Dr Malaa..I learned that I could change my wife. i could make her come to me and stop the divorce and truly love me....I love how this man do his native works. I really enjoyed( and continue to enjoy ) setting and achieving my goals with the help of DrMalaa I love how this spell caster gave me hope. It took just 12 hours of his work on my wife, but it worked!! My wife came back. For the first month that she was back, it was touch and go. I continued to spread the good news and teqnics of the doctor, and now things are better than they have ever been in our marriage. We're like newlyweds again.</p><p>If you need to save your marriage and your family, Dr Malaa is the man to contact!. Thanks</p><p>Oh!! and Dr Malaa"s contact is BESTLOVEDOCTOR@YAHOO.COM oR call +2348159645271</p>
