message: <p>My bank (Bank of Montreal) charges a fee if I deposit a USD cheque in my CAD account.  Or I can deposit the USD cheque for free into my USD account (which is also free) and immediately transfer the balance to my CAD account.  More work for them, fewer service charges for me.  I'm okay with that!<br>Nate<br></p>
