message: <p>I like the static method, but I wish there were a member method (which just called the static) as well. I'm always thrown when myString.IsNullOrEmpty() isn't defined...<br>Fortunantly, when I'm thrown, it's just a simple "throw;" rather than "throw ex", which would wipe my stack trace and really confuse me.</p>
