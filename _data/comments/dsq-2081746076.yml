message: <p>Mine was in the world of FileMaker database system.  Shortly after it became "relational".  I was working on a project, and triggered a re-lookup of data.  Which promptly started updating 200k rows.  Our entire customer database was getting "refreshed".  VERY BAD MOVE.</p><p>I learned a lot that day about "always have a backup" and "always know what a feature does before triggering it".</p>
