message: <p>You "don't accept that it's impossible"? It's like saying "I don't accept that I can't fly"... The compiler can't guess what you want.</p><p>It's easy to criticize, but I don't see you proposing a better solution, apart from "do the right thing without making me think". If you're so sure it's possible, why don't you fork the Roslyn compiler and try to make it do what you want? ;)</p>
