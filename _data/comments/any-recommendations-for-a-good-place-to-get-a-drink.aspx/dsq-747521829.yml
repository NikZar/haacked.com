message: <p>The Workshop Tavern near the RTC is a good start, go to 7541 Leary Way NE. Another popular stop is Desert Fire Restaurant located on the RTC campus (opposite Borders). This whistle stop was sometimes referred to as RTC Bldg 7 (by Cingular worker bees). However, RTC Bldg 4,5 and 6 have been converted to MS office cubes. Also, there are two hot spots located on the uppder level of RTC. go to the stairs over Ruby's Diner, first cop a feel at Victoria's Secret under the stairs.</p>
