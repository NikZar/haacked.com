message: "<p>The bottom line on open source is that if you are getting value from your contributions that makes it worth the time you spend on it, then it makes sense, regardless of the technology stack.  If you're not getting that much value, you're either: A) getting a raw deal; or B) doing charity work.  Not that there's anything wrong with B, but you should be aware of it.</p>"
