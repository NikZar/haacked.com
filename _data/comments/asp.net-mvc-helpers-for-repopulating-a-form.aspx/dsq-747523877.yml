message: <p>One more thing. Since the TempData seems to store objects, you'd have to do some casting if you store more than a simple string in it. I like to have a message object with a messagetype enum (error, warning, confirmation) and the actual message. In TempData I would liek to store more than 1 message under one key (like an array). Id always have to cast that when I get it out right?<br>Thanks!</p>
