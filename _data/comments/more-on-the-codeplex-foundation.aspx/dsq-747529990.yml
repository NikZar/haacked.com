message: <p>Phil,<br>You most probably cannot transfer ownership to the CPF.<br>While you can transfer ownership for anything that _you_ wrote, you are based on the .Text code base, so you would need the author permission as well.<br>Then you would need permission from each and every one of the committers, everyone who ever committed a patch, etc.<br>In most real projects, ownership assignment just isn't possible.</p>
