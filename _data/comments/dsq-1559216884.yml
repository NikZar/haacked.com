message: <p>Deming has a good model for this. Basically he advocated profit sharing, where all employees receive a certain percentage of company profit. This way, the "bonus" is connected with the performance of the entire company (the "system") and not individual efforts, which may or may not be in the best interest of the company. (E.g. meeting a sales quota may make an individual stand out, but net the company a loss in the long run if the new customers are not a good fit.)</p><p>Profit sharing is also good in that, as a lagging indicator, it is difficult to use it to try to motivate employees.</p>
