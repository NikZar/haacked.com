message: <p>To Ingo-Stefan,<br>You should use Response.RedirectToMobilePage in WAP sites. This is more reliable across the many mobile platforms out there.<br>Also, it will always raise a RedirectException (or something like that) which you can trap and ignore (as per Microsoft's recommendation ;-)<br>Hope this helps,<br>Tian</p>
