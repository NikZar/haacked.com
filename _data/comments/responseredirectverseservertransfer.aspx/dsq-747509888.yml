message: <p>Okay.  I have spent hours on this issue I am experiencing.  I gather I need to use server.tranfter in order to have the previous form's control values in the new page.  But after the transfer, when the second page is diaplayed, the 'isnotpostback' condition is true. Which is fine and as expected.  But When I click the submit button after the initial page is loaded, the isnotpostback is still true and only after the second time the submit button is clicked the isnotpost back condition is false.  This would result on the user clickin the page again a second time and not acceptable. <br>Furthermore, the second time the button is clicked the session variable set in the previous page is lost (even if cookieless is true) and only the session variables set in the second page is available after each postback on the new page. if the cookieless is set to false no session variables seem to retain the value.<br>I need to retain session variables between pages.<br> Any thoughts because I really am pulling my hair and questioning my sanity of wanting to write enterprise ready applications in <a href="http://asp.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="asp.net">asp.net</a><br>Thank You in advance,<br>- Myrtle</p>
