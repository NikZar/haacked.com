message: <p>Hello, <br>Thank you for this "easy to follow" walkthrough. However, nothing seems to work the way you describe it. I am using visual web developer express 2010, and I'm trying to deploy my app on a windows 2003 server with IIS 6 (wich I have control over). Is this combination not possible or what?<br>best regards <br>/Max</p>
