message: <p>Not sure of the specifics, but the variables are of type varchar, whereas your 98988 value is an integer - so you are checking varchars but trying to return in integer in your coalesce statement.<br>If you instead enclose 98988 in single quotes ('98988') making it a string value, you results would be:<br>test<br>9898</p>
