message: <p>I had the same problem as David and Michael. Here's what I did to get 1.3 installed:<br>- Download .vsix to local file system<br>- Uninstall Nuget from Control Panel<br>- Uninstall Nuget within VS 2010 (it still showed up there even after Control Panel uninstall)<br>- Double-click the .vsix to install it<br>Success!<br>Thanks for everything, Phil.<br></p>
