message: <p>The creator of PostSharp sent a pull-request that does all the reflection at compile time. So the way I did it was naive and apparently we can do most of the work at compile time with PostSharp.</p><p>Having said that, Simon Cropp sent me something to look at with Fody so I'll be checking out both approaches.</p>
