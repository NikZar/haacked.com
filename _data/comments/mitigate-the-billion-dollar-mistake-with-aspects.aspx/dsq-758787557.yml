message: <p>As for the automated test approach, I've been doing this for years with the AutoFixture.Idioms library. <a href="https://github.com/AutoFixture/AutoFixture" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://github.com/AutoFixture/AutoFixture">https://github.com/AutoFixt...</a></p><p>To use it on an entire assembly, you could do something like this:</p><p>var assembly = // some assembly<br>var fixture = new Fixture();<br>var assertion = new GuardClauseAssertion(fixture);<br>assertion.Verify(assembly);</p><p>You can fine-tune the behavior by filtering classes, or only looking at properties, constructors or whatever.</p>
