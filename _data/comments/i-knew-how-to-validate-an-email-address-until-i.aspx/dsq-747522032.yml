message: <p>Thanks for getting the word out Phil...<br>Something that isn't common knowledge, but GMAIL has a neat little Email address hack that I like to try to use sometimes...<br>With Gmail you can append a tag to your email address.  So let's say you have "name@gmail.com"  you can give someone an email address of "name++sometag@gmail.com" and it will faithfully arrive in your inbox.  The use of this for me is that I can track who's selling my email address or at least who I gave my email to that is now abusing it.<br>BTW, this site's email address validator (for comments) is wrong.  I just tried adding "++haacked" to my email address... you should fix that &lt;grin /&gt;<br></p>
