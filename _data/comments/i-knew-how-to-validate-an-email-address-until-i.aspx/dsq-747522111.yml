message: <p>I've been using your regex for sometime now to validate email addresses - it is the best I have encountered - thank you for putting<br>it out there.<br>However I just discovered that it seems to reject abc@q.com as invalid - is this intentional ?<br>I ask because there do appear to be email addresses in use where the<br>first part of the domain after the @ is a single letter.</p>
