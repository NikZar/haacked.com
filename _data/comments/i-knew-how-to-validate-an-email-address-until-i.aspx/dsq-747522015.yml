message: <p>Why try to validate? If you're being nice to the user, ask them to enter their address twice. If they get it wrong both times, tough luck. They'll find out when they don't get a message.<br>If you really want to validate, you could be up tight about it and use a proper parser, but most software does it wrong, so you'll be in the minority (along with me).<br></p>
