message: <p>Hi,<br>I found this a "nice-to-read" article ... I'm not surprised at all after reading it to end.<br>I've once built an online "Email Check" service to validate mail addresses against their domains ... what can I say ... I've studied all applying RFCs and made it work contacting the concerned server using “HELO” … my service only works with a view servers … most providers like Microsoft, Yahoo and Freenet are not even responding to a request.<br>My service still exists … but, as everyone can imagine, it’s worth nothing.<br>My résumé is that RFCs mostly serve the big industry … but they do not serve any scrubby programmer like me!<br>Best regards,<br>Raisor</p>
