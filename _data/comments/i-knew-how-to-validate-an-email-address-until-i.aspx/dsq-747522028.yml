message: <p>The O'Reilly "Mastering Regular Expressions" book has a one page regular expression that matches email address. Coming from the book of regular expressions; I assume it would be quite correct. It is towards the end of the book. Sorry, I don't have it with me right now otherwise I would have given you the page number. Enjoy.</p>
