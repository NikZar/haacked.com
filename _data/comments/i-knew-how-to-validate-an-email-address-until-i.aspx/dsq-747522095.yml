message: <p>I really see no need for world of warcraft, 2nd life, etcetera; however, there are clearly people who do see a need :) As a for instance, say your website has an 'enter your Email address to subscribe to a newsletter' input, people may not want to bother validating it as well. As long as it's well written, it in fact does work, it in fact validates all valid Email addresses, plus some that less effective parsers would ignore - all potential customers! :)</p>
