message: <p>I've had Verizon Fios for about a year.  It worked great most of that time but when I started having issues, the customer service was unavailable, I generally get a recording of "The maximum number of callers has been reached, please try again later."  Apparently the customer service has not grown along with the Fios service.  Is there another provider for the same type service?</p>
