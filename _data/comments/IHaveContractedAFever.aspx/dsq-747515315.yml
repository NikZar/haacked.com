message: <p>A chance against Italy? Well I guess you never know in soccer, ... but I would not bet on it.<br>Maybe with an early goal followed by serious defensive play and a vast amount of luck.<br>I like the U.S. game more though, Italy always plays that same boring defensive game.<br>I'm very curious about the U.S. vs Ghana match.<br>(U.S. - Iran would be nice 2 hehe)<br>Too bad Belgium did not make the tournament, ...They'd probably win the cup ;).</p>
