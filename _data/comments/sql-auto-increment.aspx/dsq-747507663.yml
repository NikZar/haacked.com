message: <p>Im changing my autoincrement column to manual incrementing so it becomes an accurate count. I renamed the column to old_column and removed the identity setting. I dropped the existing indexes and created a clustered index on the old_column. I then ran above script and the new column has values in the same order as the old_column but without the holes left due to the identity functionality. The application will now increment the column.<br>Thanks for the original code!</p>
