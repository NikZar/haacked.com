message: <p>Ok, what if you want the tags in your posts to act just like the cloud.  That you don't want it to go to another 3rd party site but simply show the list of posts by that tag.<br>If I use a provider, clicking on a tag goes to the provider rather than take them to the list of posts on my site.<br></p>
