message: <p>Whilst the comment asking the interviewer whether they want integers between 1 and 100 or reals may suggest the candidate is being a smart ass, in fact the candidate is doing what they should be doing and that is ensuring they full understand the requirements. <br>I appreciate an interviewer may feel inclined to be sarcastic at such a question from a candidate, but in fact they would be demonstrating their own failings at making sure the "spec." was complete.</p>
