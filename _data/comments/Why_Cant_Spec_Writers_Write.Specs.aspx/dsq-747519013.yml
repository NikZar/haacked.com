message: <p>Phil,<br>Well, since you are a math major, you certainly are forgetting that the spec did mention <em>divisibility</em>, and divisibility, along with the modulo and the concept of a remainder, is only applicable to the set of real integers.<br>I would however agree with the inclusive/exclusive argument. Programmers tend to always assume that they know what they know until the users tell them that they want something else.</p>
