message: <p>First - nicely done!  This is just what I was looking for. Secondly, a suggestion, You should add "Look in the log for details." to the message "github for windows failed to sync this branch." along with instructions on where the log is/how to open it. "From the main screen, Click on [about github for windows] and the click the [open log] button".</p>
