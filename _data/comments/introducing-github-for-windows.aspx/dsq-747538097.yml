message: <p>I used TortoiseGit but I never used Github before this, so this was an easy way to get started using their service, so that's definitely a win for them.<br>I can't imagine this as my default Git client (TortoiseGit feels a like a more elegant solution .. don't start up anything ... it follows you around and is just a right-click away) but I do like the Metro UI and the ease of integration with Github. <br>Great start guys! I have it paired with TortoiseGit on all my machines now. Hope it continues to get better from here on out :)</p>
