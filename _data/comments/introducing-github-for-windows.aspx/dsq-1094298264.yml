message: <p>Hi All - I have installed GitHub for Windows on Windows XP SP3 but the application will not launch when I click the desktop icon.  Where can I find the error log for the application?  Also, I have .NET 4 installed.  Do I need .NET 4.5 and if so, is it even possible to install this on XP?</p>
