message: <p>It looks amazing. I love how easy it is to clone and work with github repos. My one concern is that it may oversimplify some things. It is not particularly clear what the magical sync button does. Does it attempt to merge in any way after pulling? <br>I would also love to see a pretty commit graph that shows exactly what is going on.</p>
