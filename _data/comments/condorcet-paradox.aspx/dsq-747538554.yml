message: <p>Great post.<br>Also, wow, is that some fine artwork on the foreheads?!? It's obvious the artist spent at least 15 minutes in GIMP, mostly because he kept cracking himself up while applying the clone brush.<br>Also, slightly related - an interesting article in Wired earlier this year suggested that a small, randomly selected group of voters could do a better job than an open popular vote. Sort of like a jury trial is (hopefully) more accurate than a random poll of uninformed people on the street. <a href="http://www.wired.com/opinion/2012/05/st_essay_voting/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.wired.com/opinion/2012/05/st_essay_voting/">www.wired.com/opinion/2012/05/st_essay_voting/</a></p>
