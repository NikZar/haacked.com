message: <p>Here is another analogy, in the legal world, most companies use in-house counsel for routine transactions and outside counsel (i.e. law firms) for extraordinary or unusual transactions.  Interestingly, in-house jobs are coveted, and many star attorneys at law firms aspire to be in-house counsel and eventually general counsel (perhaps like a developer aspiring to be CTO).  In the legal world, the benefit of being in-house counsel is generally a better work/life balance.  And, yes, it is the in-house counsel that hire law firms, so you would never hear a comment like that coming from a law firm.</p>
