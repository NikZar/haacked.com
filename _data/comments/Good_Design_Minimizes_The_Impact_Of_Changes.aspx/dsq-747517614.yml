message: <p>Right now I'm looking at NHibernate and Subsonic as options.  I'm kinda leaning towards Subsonic because I think it'll be faster to implement.  Especially with Rob Conery helping out.<br>As for parameterized queries, they can be just as fast if not faster than Stored Procedures. Just not the first time you run them.</p>
