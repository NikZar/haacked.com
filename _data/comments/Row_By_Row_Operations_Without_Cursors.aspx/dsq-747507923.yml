message: "<p>Hi,<br>I'm not so deep into SQL, so I might have missed something here. But shouldn't @FirstName<br>in the line: <br>SELECT @FirstName = FirstName + ',' + @FirstName<br>actually be @FirstNames? (i.e. the thing that was declared at the beginning as: DECLARE @FirstNames VARCHAR(8000))<br>Thanks for clarifying.</p>"
