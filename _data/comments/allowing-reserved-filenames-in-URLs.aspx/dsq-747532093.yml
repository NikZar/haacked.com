message: <p>Using relaxedUrlToFileSystemMapping = 'true' works like magic. I've had issues passing doubles (like 3.45) to a service via the url. It has always failed due to the fact that ASP.Net thinks that the .45 is a file extension. now that's fixed. this addition the web.config fixed it. Thanks for the hint man... <br>Now I need to find out what security rules is this "relaxation" going to break/undermine. <br>Regards<br>Nasser</p>
