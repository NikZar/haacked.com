message: <p>Hello Phil - I guess I may be replying to an old phantom post here, but just in case you read it at some point in time.<br>Even with this setting in .Net 4.0 this does not work for me. It works in localhost (via VS2010) even without this setting &lt;httpRuntime relaxedUrlToFileSystemMapping="true" /&gt; , but when deployed on a Test server fails.</p>
