message: <p>Glad you like the plugin. I didn't know about the one Keyvan wrote until he posted a comment about it. I've updated the plugin to add the ability to edit using the Sidebar and uploaded it to Windows Live Gallery, but I'm still waiting for it to be approved.<br>If you want an advance copy, let me know and I will email it to you.</p>
