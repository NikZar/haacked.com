message: <p>You got it on the third question. We'd not develop software that would break in an upcoming release. Even if you told me what areas areas are stable, I'd still prefer to work with the finished product.<br>Also, I prefer feature rich, even if it means a longer wait for RTM. And you guys are working really fast, so let people deal with their own anxiety... And keep those releases coming to help them calm down. The Codeplex thing helps too.</p>
