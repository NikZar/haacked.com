message: "<p>I echo some of the sentiments already stated: an RTM designation is good because it represents a sense that something is complete and trustworthy.  Software with an RTM designation is much more convincing to management than something that is partly RTM'ed and partly churning.  So, for me, it is about the churn and the trust.  I need to feel that YOU think it's ready, and then I'll take my shot at it.</p>"
