message: <p>The concept of RTM is so 90's...<br>The most important thing is that we have a latest stable build and a latest development build.<br>Most of us then use the stable build, and we can discuss it and patch it as a community as necessary.<br>This type of development is the fastest way to work now days, and very familiar as well to anyone using most other web projects.<br>I'm excited about MS working toward this more modern style, although the move is a little slow I guess its understandable you don't want to get this transition wrong.</p>
