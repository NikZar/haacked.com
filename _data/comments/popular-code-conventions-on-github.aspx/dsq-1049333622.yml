message: <p>Funny thing comparing the Java &amp; Javascript results:</p><p>In many categories (notably Tabs vs Spaces, but others as well), the "more characters" option is more popular in Javascript than Java.  IOW, people who write in a interpreted language -- where source code size actually matters -- prefer coding styles which lead to larger source files.</p>
