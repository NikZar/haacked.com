message: <p>The another problem is that it also hard to put score in someone performance, since we all often wonder why that under performer, incompetent actually able to became manager or team lead.</p><p>It is easy to judge salesmen since we can just see the sales they made, for programmer there are no number to determine how well they work. Which is a shame since a lot of similar article failed to see it and think that data in performance 100%  correct therefore there are no correlation in interview and performance.</p>
