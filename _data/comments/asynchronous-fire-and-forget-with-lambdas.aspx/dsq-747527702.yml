message: "<p>@haacked: The async programming model exposed by the framework does things very differently than simply blocking a (worker pool or otherwise) thread behind the scenes. In fact the entire point is to not use a thread unless it's doing CPU intensive things rather than waiting on IO operations.<br>In any case. What threadpool are you using? I just saw QueueUserWorkItem.</p>"
