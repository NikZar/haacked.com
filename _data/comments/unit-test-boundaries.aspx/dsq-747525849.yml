message: <p>A lot of the work I have done in the past involves heavy database processing, and while I agree to some extent a unit test shouldn't require database access, the tests that specifically test a DAO definitely should.  I like using DBUnit myself - it's not perfect, but it does make me more confident in my code.</p>
