message: <p>@Chris B, I tried to post a reply to your question here - but I think I hit the comment character limit. My reply was too long it seems, so if you're interested, and since I don't have my own blog, I've posted the advice <a href="http://rant.blackapache.net/2008/07/29/unit-tests-boldly-crossing-boundaries-and-gently-breaking-rules/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://rant.blackapache.net/2008/07/29/unit-tests-boldly-crossing-boundaries-and-gently-breaking-rules/">here</a> with a reference back to this article.<br>Hope that helps.<br>Cheers,<br>Rob</p>
