message: <p>Christ, when did "ease of development" in the form of terseness outweigh code clarity and intent.  I'd much prefer fluent interfaces or even your second code snippet.<br>Your code would never make it to production in my world.  I have developers of all skill levels that need to maintain my codebase, and I ensure you I'd waste resources as they tried to figure out what your code was doing.<br>If I have to use Google to understand your intent, you fail.</p>
