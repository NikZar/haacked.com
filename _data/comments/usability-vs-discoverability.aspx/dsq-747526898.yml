message: <p>A dumb question, couldn't you solve this with overloading?<br>This also remind me of the CommandArgument property, which is a string, while the event handler providing the actual value defines it as an object. It can never be anything but a string, yet we have to downcast it every time. No one bothered to explain this decision as far as I know.</p>
