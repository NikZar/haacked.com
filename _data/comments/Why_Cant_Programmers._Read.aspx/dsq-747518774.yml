message: <p>I just laugh at people actually thinking there are 'specs'.  If I got a project with such clearly specified specs I'd be overwhelmed with joy.  Here someone would just say "fizzbuzz" to me and then after I coded tell me what they meant.  Of course I try and get everything out of them that I can.</p>
