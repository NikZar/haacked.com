message: "<p>My question is a little more fundamental: Why are all people named \"Scott\" programmers. Is this some kind of national law that I'm not aware of. Seriously, are there any Scott's who are accountants or doctors or pool cleaners? Seems like they're all in IT to me. And they all talk VERY FAST ;)<br>As for the ADD thing, I agree. Good programmers start thinking of solutions from the get go. And its only the purest NON-programmer who would ever accuse a programmer in this process of having ADD :)<br>Acutually that's a handly little way of determing whose a programmer and who isn't!</p>"
