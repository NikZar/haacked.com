message: <p>I've heard this song every day for the past month.  And I agree.  It totally sucks.  Especially the "Jaws" string line which IMHO runs on for far too long turning a classic tool for musical suspense into something just fucked up and boring.  Secondly, it couldn't be more predictable from a musical perspective.</p>
