message: <p>The problem with having a virtual dispute resolution process is that gamers, who live in the real world, want real world retribution.  Would the gamer in the article been happy if his competitor's character had gone to virtual prison, or paid a virtual fine?  He might have stabbed the guy anyway.  When virtual assets have real world value, real world solutions are needed.</p>
