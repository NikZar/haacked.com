message: <p>I'm trying to think of a plausible instance during which I'd need different versions of an assembly within a single solution, and I really can't think of one. I guess it depends on what you want to do, but I think your idea of idea allowing multiple package versions if the package doesnâ€™t contain any assemblies seems like a safe way to play it. I'm excited to use the end result!</p>
