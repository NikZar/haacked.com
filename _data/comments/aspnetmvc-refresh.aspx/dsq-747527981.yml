message: <p>I noticed the fatal execution error when I installed MVC RC.  I traced it down to an issue with that and AnkhSvn.  I turned off AnkhSvn as my source control closed the solution and then reopened it.  This seemed to have solved the problem temporarily because I need to use AnkhSvn and other addins.  Is there a fix out there for this??</p>
