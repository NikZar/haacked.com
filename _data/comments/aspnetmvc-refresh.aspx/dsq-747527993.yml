message: <p>@Mauricio @haacked<br>I set up a system where I was able to reproduce this (or at least a very similar) problem and did some troubleshooting.<br>As a workaround, I wrote an add-in that changes the load order of assemblies when working with web projects. This add-in solves the VS-crash-problem on my repro system and may or may not solve it on other systems; further testing by others affected by this bug is required to confirm this.<br>The new add-in can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.huagati.com/wpl/download/HuagatiWebProjectLoader.zip" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.huagati.com/wpl/download/HuagatiWebProjectLoader.zip">www.huagati.com/.../HuagatiWebProjectLoader.zip</a><br>It does not yet have an installer but installation is straightforward; download the file and unzip it into your Visual Studio 2008 add-in directory; typically located at \Users[username]\Documents\Visual Studio 2008\Addins on Windows Vista, or \Documents And Settings[username]\My Documents\Visual Studio 2008\Addins on Windows XP. To uninstall, simply remove the same files.<br></p>
