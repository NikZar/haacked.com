message: <p>Word on the street is that you're going to... well... there's a word on the street. :)<br>I joined MSA after I left, which is sweet for the continued access to the company store, as well as the discounted MSDN subscriptions (if you can't get it at work).<br>It sucks that you can't keep your badge. In retrospect, I should have "lost" one while I was there!</p>
