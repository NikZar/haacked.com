message: '<p>You risked your life, wearing an Italy shirt in a french restaurant...<br>...on the other hand, wearing a "winning" shirt is way better than wearing a "losing" shirt: I was in Barcelona 3 years ago, right after Milan FC was sent off the Champions League by Deportivo La Coruna (4-0 comeback after 1-4 in the first round), and when people realized we were italians, they mocked us for hours :-)</p>'
