message: <p>Back before IM there was zephyr from the Athena Project at MIT.  zephyr had channels.  You could subscribe to a channel, and when someone sent an IM to it, it would broadcast out.<br>That's something that has been missing from most IM packages I've seen since.  IM allows you to invite your friends if they are online, but it doesn't allow you to just quickly broadcast something out to you friends, and the ones who are online get the message.<br>It sounds like this twitter is kind of like that?<br></p>
