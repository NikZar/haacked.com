message: <p>This seems like a logical implementation of a transaction.  After all, if you are explicitly using a transaction isn't the general intent to commit it?<br>How will this behave if I do an explicitly rollback from within the transaction's Action? Transaction.Complete() must respect a previous rollback() I imagine. (Haven't worked with txs much.) So after an explicit Rollback() the implicit Complete() really has nothing to do so it can still execute.</p>
