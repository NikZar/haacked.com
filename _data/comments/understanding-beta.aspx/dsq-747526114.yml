message: <p>@Jonathan yeah, I didn't include RC which stands for "Release Candidate". RC's are pretty much like less buggy BETA releases. These are candidates to become the actual release and there is a very small chance of adding new features between the RC and the RTM. Any changes from an RC to an RTM are usually just bug fixes.</p>
