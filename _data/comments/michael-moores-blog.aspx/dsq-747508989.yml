message: <p>I just saw "SiCKO" in New Hampshire-it is brilliant.I went with nurse friends fom the MNA.  I came to the sickening realization that our nation's economy is now based soley on Killing people-sacrificing people!!!   - in Iraq and in the "for profit" health care system which is the the only rising profit business right now in this country and it makes me sick. These hospital industries are the new Robber Barons. <br>Thank you for your bravery Michael Moore.</p>
