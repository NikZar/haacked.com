message: <p>I think your movie SICKO will give usall somthing to think about for a long time to come. And just maybe the right people will see it and try and do better with our health care system. I pay an outragous price for healthcare after my husband died( police officer for 33 years) just so my two children can have care. And what they charge is crazy!!!! Both the Dr. and the Med.<br>Thanks Mr Moore for showing us how other coountries do it. I am inclined to move just to get the benifits of health care and collage.<br>Hope you all watch it and think of how this will affect us in years to come...........</p>
