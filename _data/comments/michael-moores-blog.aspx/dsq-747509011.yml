message: <p>Today I went out to the post office. I decided to speak to the woman in line ahead of me. I thought I ought to point out that in ww2 a democrat in a wheelchair managed to wrap up the Japaneese and the Germans in 4 short years. I was shocked to find that I was confronted with a know nothing from the political past.It was fair game to harrang Democrats in the past yet those bushies cant take the heat.</p>
