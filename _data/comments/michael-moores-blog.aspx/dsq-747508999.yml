message: <p>"However, anyone who speaks Spanish can tell that not only is Ms. Cervantes clearly not a native Spanish speaker (she even stated her birthday in an incorrect form when she was being admitted), but that she certainly does not speak with a Cuban accent. Given that - not to mention the fact that none of you were wearing clothes that the average, impoverished Cuban wears - would have definitely clued the Cuban hospital personnel that she was a foreigner and, therefore, should receive superior care"<br>I am a native speaker and received my primary education in spanish in the US because you GREAT IGNORANT DORK I am PuertoRican!  Clearly you never saw the film.<br>Reggie</p>
