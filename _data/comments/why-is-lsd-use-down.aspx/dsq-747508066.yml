message: <p>Yo I'll tell you why LSD use is down. No one wants to spent 10 hours tripping no more. People want a quick, easy fix. They want fun, not spiritual enlightenment. The kids these days don't understand drugs like LSD. they'd much rather prefer their ecstasy or cocaine because they need their over-stimulated mind to be even more stimulated. LSD is for those who have patience. there aint no more patient kids no more. When i told my friend they he had to wait at least 40 minutes for the trip to hit them, he bit me. Peace and Love.</p>
