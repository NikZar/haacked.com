message: <p>The fact that there are not many suppliers of the drug is a direct result of the lack of demand for the drug.  If LSD was still a popular drug among young people, more individuals with the knowledge of LSD manufacture would take the risk of making it.  The bottom line is that there is not as much money to be made making LSD as there has been in the past.  The simple rules of supply and demand have tapered off LSD manufacture.</p>
