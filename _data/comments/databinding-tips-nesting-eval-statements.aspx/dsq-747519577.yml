message: <p>Phil,<br>I hear ya. For me, when I hear "if x then y else z", I think "logic", and I'd rather have it tested. Plus, I'd rather capture that requirement ("the second thing isn't displayed if the first thing isn't") somewhere - the natural place being a test.<br>But I agree, it's a fine line.</p>
