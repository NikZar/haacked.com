message: <p>I always end up putting such wacky formatting for repeaters inside a codebehind method that simply outputs the string I want.<br>That way rather than fix it in multiple places when my client inevitably asks to change the format its easy to maintain.<br>Case in point, I was using "N/A" to denote blank and my client wanted it changed to an image.  Because the return of N/A was wrapped in a method I just had to change the method to return an &lt;img&gt; tag.</p>
