message: <p>I used Dare's code because I figured posting to Delicious was more similar than posting to w.Bloggar since I have to save the user's username and password and actually post information over the web.<br>In the end, there were enough differences that I still ended up having to write alot of code.  But at least I didn't have to write the encryption/decryption stuff.</p>
