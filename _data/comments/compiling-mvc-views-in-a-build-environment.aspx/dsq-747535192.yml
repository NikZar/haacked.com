message: <p>Hi Phil, This solution didn't work for me (I encountered this problem even though I was already using the revised/fixed template). I needed to do &lt;BaseIntermediateOutputPath&gt;[SomeKnownLocationIHaveAccessTo]&lt;/BaseIntermediateOutputPath&gt;. Any idea why that might be? Could it be that I have my WebProjectOutputDir set incorrectly?</p>
