message: <p>The second book you chose is the textbook I use in my web design classes so obviously I think it's a good one. If I had a complaint it'd be that it includes too much on the "old ways".<br><br><br><br>Fireworks is likely to be a dying product in my opinon. It was always a Photoshop wannabe and now that Adobe has purchased Macromedia I don't expect that it will live on much longer. Photoshop is the industry standard, if you have to pick one go with that.<br><br><br><br>Bryan Covington<br><br>&lt;a href="<a href='http://www.admodumdigirati.com">Ad' rel="nofollow noopener" title='http://www.admodumdigirati.com">Ad'>http://www.admodumdigirati.com"&gt;Ad</a> Modum Digirati&lt;/a&gt;</p>
