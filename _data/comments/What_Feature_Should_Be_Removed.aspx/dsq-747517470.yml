message: <p>perhaps one could tag certain posts as being articles, as an attribute of the post, and then make it easy to include them in the sidebar just like the useful references on this blog.  But they're still just standard entries.  Why duplicate all the functionality to insert, update, delete and otherwise manage?</p>
