message: <p>Please keep the articles section. I use this section quite a bit to back up articles I've written on other sites.I know most people use subtext purely for blogging but i try and use it as the basis for an archive of my webby stuff. Articles included.<br>I would agree about losing some of the packaged skins though. They are very hit and miss and half the time you end up editing them anyway to fix their bugs. Either that or writing your own.</p>
