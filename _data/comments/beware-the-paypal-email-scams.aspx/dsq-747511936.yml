message: <p>WOW, nearly was scammed. I got that message today -- like everyone is talking about here- tracking number then payment will be provided. I just wanted to say-- also check out <a href="http://www.paypalsucks.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="www.paypalsucks.com">www.paypalsucks.com</a>. Both this and that site- were very useful. Be aware people- I'm your average person-- and was nearly frauded out of $2000 like other people on this page. Never would have realized it. Paypal and ebay were reported of my problem (well if it would have taken place) they did nothing-- YOUR ON YOUR OWN-- KEEP WARY WHEN DOING THINGS ON THESE SITES.</p>
