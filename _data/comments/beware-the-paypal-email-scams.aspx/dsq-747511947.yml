message: <p>Chris,<br>John Jamesimi did the same thing to me and used the same address.  I sent him 4 PS3's.  The same thing happened with the paypal too.  I thought that paypal was a middle man who held funds and waited for proof that the items were shipped just so that people can't scam anyone.  I was wrong.  I lost $3630 that was supposed to be sent to my account.  I never saw a dime.  What is this world coming too?</p>
