message: <p>I received an email thought it was from paypal asying they had accepted payment for a subscription to some nudist thing, checked with hubby as he has been using ebay but it was addressed to me he had know idea. Without thinking I clicked the link, it took me to BBC website. Is anything likely to happen because I clicked the link? I've run all my virus protectors etc is there any more I can do??</p>
