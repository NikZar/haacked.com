message: <p>Often, the various comments to a particular post are sometimes as interesting as the post itself.  Many of your "non-techie" posts are on <a href="http://haacked.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="haacked.com">haacked.com</a> blog as well as <a href="http://phil.haacked.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="phil.haacked.com">phil.haacked.com</a>, but you get far more comments for the same entry on <a href="http://haacked.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="haacked.com">haacked.com</a>.  Is there any way to combine the comments sections of each entry that is posted on both blogs?  One easy, but probably not technically elegant, way to do this would be to direct the user to the <a href="http://haacked.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="haacked.com">haacked.com</a> entry of the post when the user clicks on the <a href="http://phil.haacked.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="phil.haacked.com">phil.haacked.com</a> entry.<br>Just a thought.</p>
