message: "<p>Real story: 10 years ago I was working the in the Grand Canyon (South Rim) and we would party nearly every night after work (many of us worked the night shift at the restaurant at the El Tovar hotel). One night a couple of the people I would hang with decided to do flaming shots (using Bacardi 151, if I remember correctly). This same thing happened to a guy by the name of Chris, on account of his being already drunk and unable to aim correctly . . . so, it went in his mouth and all over his face and neck. While he didn't shoot flames from his mouth like this guy, he *did* sustain some pretty scary-looking burns which stayed with him for months afterward. Although I have not seen him since I worked there, I can almost bet he would not be found doing these ever again.<br><br></p>"
