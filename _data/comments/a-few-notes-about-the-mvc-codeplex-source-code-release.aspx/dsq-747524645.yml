message: <p>Phil,<br>I highly appreciate that MVC code is published on Codeplex. It is always good to see how other people write code, and it is also excellent way to use that code for learning, (just to mention Scott Hanselman's Weekly Source Code series).<br>Can you post more details about your team, i.e how many Dev's, PM's and other people is currently working on MVC project (including Routing and Abstractions part of it), just to compare it with the fact that MVC source (without Routing and Abstractions part) is approximately only 300kB, and how is organized development process inside your team. I know I'm entering into some tricky legal issues, so post only details that are not so secret to be kept from the eyes of public (I'm just curious)<br>Thanks!</p>
