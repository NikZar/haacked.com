message: <p>Having used JavaScript for many years I have always considered optional parameters as a necessary evil due to the lack of method overloading. In C# I don't ever use optional parameters. If I have a method where a parameter could be optional I create 2 overloaded methods outlining the different uses of the method. Much easier to understand and it avoids problems like these.</p>
