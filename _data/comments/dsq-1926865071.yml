message: <p>George there are 'urgent' and 'urgent' emails :) If there is a fire then sure I will pick it up and try to help, but if something is not really critical then 23:00 o'clock email is just ignored, also 10-12 hrs / day, ouch ,it feels like some crunch mode, death march project to me :)</p>
