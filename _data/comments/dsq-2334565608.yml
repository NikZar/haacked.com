message: <p>I love these type of tips and tools posts/discussions. A lot of times, those that know take for granted that everyone knows such tips. And it's not just about having a cool looking console. These tweaks add up quickly to more productivity and more fun getting the job done. Thanks for sharing. Oh, and I love Github Desktop. Even though I do a lot of my git work via cli, Github Desktop is my "overview". It's what I tell anyone new to git to install first.</p>
