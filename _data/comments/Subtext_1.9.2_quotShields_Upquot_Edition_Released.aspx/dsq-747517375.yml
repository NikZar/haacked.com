message: <p>Congratulations! This is exciting. However, I'm almost embarassed to post this comment because I have been planning on doing extensive testing prior to this release and I just could not get the time to do it. Sorry I could not help more before the release, but you guys made an incredible effort and implemented some really important features for Subtext. Thank you so much for the improved spam solution. I'm going to try setting it up in medium trust, so I'll let you know how that goes.</p>
