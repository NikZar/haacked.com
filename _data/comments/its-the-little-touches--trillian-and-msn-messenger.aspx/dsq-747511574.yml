message: <p>Is there any way to recieve this info from Trillian?  I know a few people that have this setting enabled on thier MSN client, and i want to be able to see it using my Trillian client.<br>I tend to rename my contacts with sensible names inside my client (perhaps this is hiding the info).  I have tried toggling the "toggle email/friendly name display", to no avail. <br>I might be missing something silly, but i thank you in advance for any advice.</p>
