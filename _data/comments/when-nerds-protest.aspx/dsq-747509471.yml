message: <p>Fizzle, Actually if you read my post here <a href="http://haacked.com/archive/2004/08/31/1031.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://haacked.com/archive/2004/08/31/1031.aspx">http://haacked.com/archive/2004/08/31/1031.aspx</a> you'll see that capitalization is an issue if you wish to be XHTML compliant.  <br><br><br><br>If you're only concerned with XML or HTML individually, then yes, it's a non-issue.  But according to the W3C spec, lowercase is required for XHTML.  It makes sense.  In XML, the &lt;li&gt; &lt;LI&gt; &lt;Li&gt; elements are all different elements.</p>
