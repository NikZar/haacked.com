message: <p>Geeze you guys are way toooo nerdy.  Dumb! Dumb!  Doh! I like most Americans are tried of the childishness displayed by the Dems.  Doh!  It wasn't the Swift Boat ads that sank Kerry, it was the childish comments.  For example the "Get rid of Mad Cowboy Disease" ad by the DNC.  Why should we take a candidate serious when his supporters treat the election like it was for junior high class president.  And i'm really tried of the vote for me I have metal in my butt line.  Give us real issues, truthful comments and stop all the whinning.</p>
