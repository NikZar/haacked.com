message: "<p>PK: It might have been a bit clearer if Phil had written, \"What I this person really wants is a new *route* handler specifically for http handlers.\" In other words, you want to define a route which does something other than fire off an action. It lets you use routing rather than web.config to configure handlers. The idea is that you shouldn't need to write a new route handler if you already have an http handler, of which there are a lot.</p>"
