message: <p>Phil,<br>You've been quite the minutiae maniac lately.  So I thought I'd strike back :)<br>"Quick, what's the 49th state alphabetically?" <br>You make no guarantee to me via your API that the States have been loaded into the collection alphabetically.  So I would have to sort your list myself so I'd have to create my own list/array because I can't sort your list in place because it's read-only!<br>Your move my friend.</p>
