message: <p>calling RouteTable.Routes.RegisterRoutes("~/...") in Application_Start is not enough, because it won't call the ReloadRoutes() at the first time while the file is not changed.<br>ReloadRoutes() should be called after Listen() in RegisterRoutes(), doesn't it?<br>(sorry for the wrong post in "ASP.NET Route Debugger")</p>
