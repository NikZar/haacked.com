message: <p>@Ale≈° I could have used the App_Code folder and called <code>BuildManager.GetType("Routes")</code> and that would have worked too.<br>As Adam points out, that would cause a full AppDomain and Views recycle when you change a route. I wanted to avoid that. It does have the benefit that I don't have to manage my own file monitoring, which is a big benefit. :)</p>
