message: <p>I also make Manhattans at home but like to mess around with different bitters and garnishes. I recently enjoyed orange bitters with crushed ginger and a twist of grapefruit. Lavender bitters with whatever frozen fruit happens to be in the freezer is also quite nice (if you enjoy florals).</p>
