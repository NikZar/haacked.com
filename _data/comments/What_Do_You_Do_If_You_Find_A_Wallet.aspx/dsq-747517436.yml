message: <p>Shoot, my wife noticed her wallet was missing after we left our neighborhood athletic club.  It was late so we just were going to go in early the next morning.  We had forgotten that she had $400 in cash sitting in her wallet.<br>They took the wallet, the cash, but we cancelled all the cards before they got "brave".  I understand taking the cash, but the wallet?  Why couldn't they have left it there?  That was another huge pain in the butt replacing ID's, CC's, etc.</p>
