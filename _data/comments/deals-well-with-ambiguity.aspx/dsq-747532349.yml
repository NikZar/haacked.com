message: <p>As much as I would like to see AI, the core principle of a computer is logic.  Without allowing the computer itself to learn in some capacity, over time, the dealing with ambiguity couldn't even begin -- there's some level of feeling involved (completely irrational, illogical ... emotion!)<br>So I would tweak your idea and ask not (what your country can do for you) why can't it deal with ambiguity ... how do we make a computer think, learn and have some kind of emotions all by itself?<br>-insert picture of Commander Data here-</p>
