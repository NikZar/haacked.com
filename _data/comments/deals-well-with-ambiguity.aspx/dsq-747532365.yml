message: <p>From the perspective of a speculative fiction writer, the computers that are prevalent in works of science fiction are able to handle ambiguity well.  That's what allows them to really take on the role of characters in a story.  The computers that exist today are (for the most part) so darn literal that they are impossible to interact with in a meaningful way.</p>
