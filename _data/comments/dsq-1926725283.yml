message: <p>But when you send an email you immediately follow up with a phone call right? And if they don't answer right away you send a fax that says "You're Fired" to the fax machine in every room, right?</p><p>Or maybe you just understand, and you understand that your team understands, and they understand that you understand that they understand, that emails are asynchronous.</p>
