message: <p>Sad thing is, I know you are working on our build process at work currently (July 2007), and I honestly didn't read the date on this post until I got to the comments.  You really must get tired of reliving your life over and over again? Because your comments apply DIRECTLY to what we are going through now... so scary it is almost funny, almost.</p>
