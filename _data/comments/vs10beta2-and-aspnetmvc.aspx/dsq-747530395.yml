message: <p>Phil,<br>I'm struggling to get MVC working with 2010 b2. It announced an error around around MVC, and now wont work with any MVC2 projects. Dissapointing. It relates to beta one being installed. MVC 1.1 seems to be the culprit, but it won't let me uninstall that.  Are there any easy fixes?<br>A</p>
