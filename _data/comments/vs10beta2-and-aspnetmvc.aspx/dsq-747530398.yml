message: <p>I have seen that there is a Go-live license for Visual Studio 2010 beta 2.  I am wondering how mature ASP.NET MVC 2 beta 2 is.  I am currently creating a MVC app that won't go live until say January of next year.  How safe would I be in upgrading to Visual Studio 2010 and ASP.NET MVC 2 now?</p>
