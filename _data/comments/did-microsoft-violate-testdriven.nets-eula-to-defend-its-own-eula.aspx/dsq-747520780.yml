message: <p>Comparing EULA to taking songs off Napster defies credibility.<br>Nobody is violating copyright law here.<br>What we're talking about here is basically the equivalent of a record label releasing music with an EULA that prohibits you from singing along.<br>Does that sound silly?<br>Well so does violating an EULA by tweaking a setting in the registry.</p>
