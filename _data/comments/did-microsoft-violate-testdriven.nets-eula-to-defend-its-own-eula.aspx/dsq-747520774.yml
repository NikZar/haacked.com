message: <p>@Joe -<br>Sharing music illegally or sexually abusing children is a poor comparison to the situation.  Those both CLEARLY violate the law, the latter to fullest extent.    There are different severities in criminal law (misdemeanor, felony), how about in civil law?  Are all violations of the EULA weighted the same?  Should he face the same penalty as someone who reverse engineered the IDE and put it out as their own?<br>I personally see this situation more of a gray area of the IP vacuum because you can spin this in either direction too easily.  Is the "technical limitation" meaning the ability to do it or the intent.  Microsoft should have written it as "You may not work around any technical limitations, actual or intended in the software."  <br><br></p>
