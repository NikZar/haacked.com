message: <p>I am primarily a .NET person but recently got to know people outside my community in organizing Seattle GiveCamp. It was great because I got to attend other meetings and meet people outside of the .NET/SQL Server mindset.<br>We can all learn from each other. Personally, I think there's too much focus on technology for technology sake out there. There's a real benefit to sticking with one technology or family of technologies--you don't spend all your waking hours constantly learning new stuff and can actually get productive. OTOH, sometimes, looking outside your comfort zone is good for you.<br>In general, though, I have found most communities are filled with people who want to help each other which is great for all!</p>
