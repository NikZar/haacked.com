message: <p>So true, Its becoming a religion for some people, "The Holy .net Grail" :). But I also think that the .NET community at least in Denmark is aware of this, and tries to make som e cracks in this believe. Its always time to get inspired my other technologies to be able to make great solutions. Just look at the mongodb vs. RavenDb. The latter one is more .NET friendly, but at the moment there are no hosting providers, so people are forced to look outside the one "Circle of Truth" :) if the want to use a document db.</p>
