message: <p>Somehow, it looks like .NET developers become exclusive to themselves. But if other community can be proud of themselves, why not .NET developers too. The pride is still there. And I love to be .NET developer. Although most of us, probably, also develop using other than .NET as well, like JavaScript. But, it's true.</p>
