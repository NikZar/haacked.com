message: <p>It shouldn't be too surprising that people who like cool open source projects (such as Ruby or node.js) attend sessions about cool open source projects.  It might also be a factor that some of these projects don't work too well on Windows, and .NET is primarily focused on Windows (though I really do love Mono).<br>I think a lot of .NET user groups would welcome people from non-.NET fields, but a lot of people in the FOSS world follow Stallman's view that .NET == evil, just because it was originated by Microsoft.</p>
