message: <p>I don't know if it's an idiomatic difference, but to me, hypothesis and a theory are pretty much the same, a statement about how we believe something works/behaves but not proven right. For example, the String Theory.<br>Those are opposed to/different than a theorem(which I think is what you meant) or law.<br>Technicalities apart, it's nice going from being a TDD-believer/TDD-ist to a TDD-ician.<br></p>
