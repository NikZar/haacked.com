message: <p>Here is what is driving me nuts. Tablet PC manufacturers are appealing to every market except the ONE that tablets are virtually made for by design... ILLUSTRATION. I want a tablet PC because I want to draw on the screen like I draw on paper. I was told that PC tablets lack pressure sensitivity like the Wacom tablets have. If they do, why, since most license the tech from Wacom anyhow? I gues what I'm asking is this, does anyone know how the M200 or any these slates or tablet PCs handle Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator or Macromedia Flash8?<br>Thank you for your time.</p>
