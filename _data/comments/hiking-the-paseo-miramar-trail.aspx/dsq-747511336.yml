message: <p>Love, love, love this trail.  I always take guests on this hike and it's perfect b/c the views are beautiful and it's not too difficult of a hike for anyone. It's a bit too intense for my parents who prefer a relaxing easy hike, but it's a lot of fun if you want a moderate workout and beautiful scenery. <br></p>
