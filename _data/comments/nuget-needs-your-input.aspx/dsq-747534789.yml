message: <p>One thing about "versions" are platforms.<br>I tend to have solutions with .NET, SL, and WP7 projects - so while I might use the same "version" of a package - the actual DLLs are often targeted at these different platforms.<br>I still do want the versions kept in sync - but the .NET project gets the .NET version, the SL project gets the SL version, etc.</p>
