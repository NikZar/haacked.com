message: <p>@Kyralessa But suppose you wanted only a subset of projects or ones that ended with *test? The beauty of the ps commands isn't just what they can do, it's how smaller commands can be composed to build more complex commands (See MvcScaffolding). So I with Format-Document you can do:<br># Format all test projets<br>Get-Project *.Test | Format-Document</p>
