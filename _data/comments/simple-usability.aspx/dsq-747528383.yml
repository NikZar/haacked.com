message: <p>I totally agree! I was scrambling Friday morning at MIX to download videos to watch on my zune on the 5 hour flight back, but it was next to impossible to figure out which videos were available. I had to select each slot. If I only wanted to check out the video of a particular session, the UI would have been fine, but since I wanted to download any videos I could, the UI was totally inappropriate.</p>
