You could always leave it untested !;)<br>Being a novice and all, here's what I feel about this testable class creation right off the bat:<br>Partial mocks = <strong>automated</strong> = good<br>Test Specific Subclasses = <strong>manual</strong> = bad<br>Yes, it's an oversimplification, but put it this way: why do you prefer \"having my test fully self-contained\" if you're not having the same \"dirty\" feeling that these other devs are expressing? Maybe you're just less sensitive to the dirt?</p>"
