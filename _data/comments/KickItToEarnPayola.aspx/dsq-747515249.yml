message: <p>As you mentioned, currently there is little incentive for users to kick other than the community benefits. Each user does have their own page and feed (eg. <a href="http://www.dotnetkicks.com/users/Haacked)" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.dotnetkicks.com/users/Haacked)">http://www.dotnetkicks.com/...</a>. This would be much more useful in conjunction with tagging, I am hoping to add that feature in the not to distant future.</p>
