message: <p>I use the Microsoft photo album software, and the tag feature is something I really like about it.  With one click I can pull up any photo with certain individuals or a landscape or city-scape, etc.  It would be nice if Flickr could upload my existing tags along with the photos (maybe it can, I haven't tried).  Also, a "view similar" feature, where Flickr finds other photos (either from your network or all public photos) based on composition would be nice.<br><br><br><br>By the way, Phil, I saw you added me as a tag.  Thanks!</p>
