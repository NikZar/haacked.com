message: <p>Thanks for the post Phil,<br>Like Michael Reyeros I too have problems with the deserialization of the JSON response. The properties of the object I receive in my action method are not set. When I use my own model binder and leave out the value provider the properties are all set. I would like to have the validation, but it seems I can't use both the value provider and a custom model binder.<br>Any help/ideas would be greatly appreciated.</p>
