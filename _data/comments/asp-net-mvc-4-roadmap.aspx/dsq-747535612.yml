message: <p>&gt;&gt; I saw a comment that described recipes as "Wrapping a UI around a command line.". That's not the goal nor purpose of recipes.<br>I agree. MVCScaffolding is a great tool which I use and customise frequently - but (despite my earlier criticism of wizards)- I often wish it had some kind of GUI if only to remind/prompt you of its many functions and options - If the "recipe" concept and API will allow tool-makers (or customizers) to easily achieve that, it would be a great idea.</p>
