message: <p>So...all these tooling ideas...was community actually asking for it? There are all these core issues that people  have been asking even on your blog...yet you guys keep coming up with things seemingly out of no where.  Even all this scaffolding stuff...rails guys aren't even encouraging using it. Just seems like more demo-driven features...we like mvc cause its not webforms...yet here we go with more wizards</p>
