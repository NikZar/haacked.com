message: <p>There are many options for bundling CSS, JavaScript, why do you feel you need to reinvent the wheel? Is it all for the 'tooling'? <br>I am really getting sick of Microsoft reinventing the wheel only to sell more tools. You are NOT acknowledging the community, it's becoming a mono culture and I'm almost done with it.</p>
