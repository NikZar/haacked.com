message: <p>"Better support for functional and integration testing of application code."<br>Does that mean we'll finally be able to write real unit tests for our views?  <br>Weâ€™ve got a pretty robust system and we could really use the tuning we get from writing unit tests around our helper classes that output a Razor view. We've been compiling our views and hope that we can now just bind a model to them and check the output.<br></p>
