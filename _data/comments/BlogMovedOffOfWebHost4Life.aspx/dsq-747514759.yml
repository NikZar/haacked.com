message: <p>webhost4life are a bunch of pirates anyway <br>despite stating that email is included as are multiple domains the truth is that only the first domain is free for email and all other domains can only be attached at root level. If you want to attach at subdirectory then a charge of $15yr is made. They are completely unwilling to state what else will be charged for. You will also find that despite their guarentee of a full refund this does not include the setup fee.<br>DO NOT TOUCH WEBHOST4LIFE WITH A BARGEPOLE</p>
