message: <p>Thanks for this. Your sample "zip" is invalid, though, which is frustrating, and your contact page is broken. however, with your hard drive crashes I imagine that is the least of your worries. Good luck! When you might be able to get the code sample back on line, that would be a great boon.</p>
