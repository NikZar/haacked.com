message: <p>My first reaction when I heard about areas being for multiple projects was that I would want this to work in single projects as well.  This is partly driven by a desire to have as few a projects in a solution as possible because it makes it easier to move things around.  <br>So, for me I would like to see this in the box for MVC 2.<br></p>
