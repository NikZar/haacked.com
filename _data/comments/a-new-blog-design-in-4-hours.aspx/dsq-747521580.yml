message: <p>I really liked the book as well and took away the same core points; don't waste your time on things that are not important. I am sure he exaggerated on some of the details, but I am not expecting to work just four hours a week anytime soon anyway. <br>A great book on a similar type of topic is Seth Godin's Dip.</p>
