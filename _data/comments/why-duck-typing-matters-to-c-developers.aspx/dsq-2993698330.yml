message: <p>How is this scenario significantly different for a manually written proxy class?  If you write a proxy to support unit testing and the class you are consuming with that proxy changes in a way that does not alter the portions of the interface your proxy interacts with the same problems exist.   Adding void Bar2() would not trigger compile time warnings or errors in a proxy that only uses void Bar1().</p>
