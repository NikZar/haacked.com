message: <p>When I updated to the latest Subtext and was having email problems. I was able to solve the problem so I do get notified when comments / contact form submissions are made. If you upgrade to 2.5 and run into the "email isn't being sent" issue, make sure you're logged out. Log out of both the HostAdmin and the blog proper.</p>
