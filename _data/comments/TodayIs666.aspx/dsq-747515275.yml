message: <p>I never ever thought I would see the lyrics to that song on the web, much less on a programming blog. I saw the Surfers several times while in school (loved their stuff) and that brought back some memories. <br>A friend of mine once played a really nasty trick on some door-to-door missionaries using that song - he had his roommate go cue up the "SATAN" part while he engaged the people at the door, feigning interest in their teachings. At last, when all was ready, he ended the conversation by syaing something like "Well, that all sounds really good, but the problem is that I am a follower of..." and then the roommate hit play, with the stereo at 11 :-)<br></p>
