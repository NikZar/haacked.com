message: <p>Thanks Phil. I was struggling with this for a while, and even posted on StackOverflow about my problem - <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1968772/asp-net-mvc-database-driven-menu-with-caching" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1968772/asp-net-mvc-database-driven-menu-with-caching">ASP.Net MVC Database-driven menu with caching</a>.<br>Sadly no-one was able to help. Then I bumped into your post, and kicked myself coz I read it before but it just didn't click in my recyle bin of a brain...</p>
