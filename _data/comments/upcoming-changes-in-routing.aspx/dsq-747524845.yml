message: <p>@Vijay, yeah spaces are encoded to "%20", i think perhaps they should be encoded to "+" which is what happens when you submit a form with method="get"<br>That would also mean that routing should decode "+" to space! As it stands at the moment, you would end up with a + in the RouteData.<br>@Haacked, lovin these changes! Keep it up.</p>
