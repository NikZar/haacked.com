message: <p>Hi Phil,<br>Visual Studio has a command windows. But, thats not exactly used by a lot of developers and it has limitations as well. Just like Steve Sanderson MVC Scaffolding. Can't we think of building plugin's to nuget package manager, which helps you lot of tasks from command line, like clean, build release build make nsis installer etc. Start and attach to a process. <br>Regards<br>Mohit Thakral</p>
