message: <p>A good way to solve your problem of excess weight is to stop over eating. <br>When you feel like venturing into the kitchen to find food, quickly take off your clothes (or lift up top if your very lazy) and look at your body in the mirror. The sight should instantly get rid of the urge for food.</p>
