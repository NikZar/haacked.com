message: <p>Any ideas for keeping your mind off food? I can go an entire day with out real food if I want to. Then at night I want to eat everything in my grasp. I've tried to balance and eat more through out the day but nothing seems to crave my need for too much food at night. I'm not over weight at all but I've started to think about food more and more often and I've started to stack on pounds for the first time in my life. What to do!?</p>
