message: <p>I am 14, almost 15. I daily think about starving myself into losing weight, because I am really overweight. Even now I'm trying to resist eating, even though I'm starving because I've only had one meal today. I know I'll give in. I always do. And then I'll overeat.<br>I gained about 40lbs in one year when I was 11. My mom is worried about me, and I'm worried, too. I don't want to end up having to get a surgery like someone else I know just to lose weight. I try to diet, but I never have the willpower to resist the cookies and bread that lie in the kitchen. It's like they're calling to me and I can't resist it.<br>I keep saying I'll do it later. I'll diet later. But these happen to be the hardest years of my life, so isn't this the ideal time? But I still can't do it. The most I've ever lost was 10lbs, and that was because I was stuck in the hospital for two weeks (appendicitis).<br>I need help. Should I talk to my doctor?</p>
