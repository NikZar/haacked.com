message: "<p>My only problem with testing urls is I don't really care what my urls look like, read: \"I have no *good* reason to care\". As long as when i call ActionLink passing in whatever values, it generates a url such that requesting that url will pass those values to my controller action. If that is true then I'm happy.</p>"
