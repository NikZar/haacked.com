message: '<p>Congrats Phil, great work. <br>I downloaded it and set it up. Installation was way too easy, but it looks like some images are missing. Also when I tried to add a new post, I got the following error<br>Post operation failed. The error message related to this problem was as follows: Could not find file "c:\subtextblog\emoticons.txt". <br>I added an empty emoticons.txt empty text file to the root folder, and every thing worked fine.</p>'
