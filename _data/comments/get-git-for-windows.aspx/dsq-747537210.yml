message: <p>Any help getting ssh-agent set up and installed?  I have posh-git all set up and I can pull down from my private repository on Github, but I am still being prompted for my "super-secret phrase" on every command.  And when I 'Start ssh-agent' a cmd prompt flashes but nothing really changes.</p>
