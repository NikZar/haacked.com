message: <p>Perry,<br>You should be running 'Start-sshagent' not 'Start ssh-agent'.  That said, I see the ssh-agent process start and I still get prompted every time.  I do have my machine set up with multiple keys and a config file in my .ssh directory.  Does this only work in the simple case?<br>Thanks,<br>Bradley</p>
