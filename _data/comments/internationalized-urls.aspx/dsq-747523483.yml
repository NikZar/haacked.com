message: <p>@Lance - exactly. After all, it's the hoster of the site who has to *own* the domain name and set it up in IIS. Subtext does require you configure that domain name (since we allow multiple blog hosting in a single blog). The only thing we can do is help you with converting a unicode host name to the Punycode.</p>
