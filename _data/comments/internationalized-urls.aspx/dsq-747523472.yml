message: <p>You say that when a user types the URL in the address bar, Browsers automatically apply the correct URL encoding. But as far as I have observed, they dont apply Unicode encoding, rather latin-1, so it doesnt work if you type Ã¼ for example, which becomes %FC instead of %C3%BC. Any ideas?<br>Wikepedia seems to convert it somehow and redirects you to the right page.</p>
