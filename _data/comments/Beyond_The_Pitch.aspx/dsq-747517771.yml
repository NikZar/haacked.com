(you know, the sport we actually use feet ;) ). <br>Here in Brazil it is like the air we breath, no space left for other sports. <br>NBA made us pay some attention to basketball, even the exotic NFL can have its fun. But we still don't get baseball or NASCAR racing! What the hell is that!?<br>Good blog! Thumbs up!<br><br><br></p>"
