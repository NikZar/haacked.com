message: <p>Nothing is wrong with that. But in my case, I didn't want to use a Nullable Boolean.<br>If you really want a try-state boolean, then there's no point in even using the null coalescing operator.  <br>Otherwise, if you really only want true or false, then you're using a nullable type just to save having to type another pair of parenthesis.  Why?</p>
