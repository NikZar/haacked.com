message: <p>In case people have the same question:</p><p>If the line Assert.Throws&lt;t&gt;(() =&gt; { }) is reached it means that testCode has executed without throwing any exceptions, which is a test failure (we are asserting that testCode throws an exception). The line Assert.Throws&lt;t&gt;(() =&gt; { }) is there to force the test to fail, the empty lamba will never throw the desired exception.</p>
