message: <p>I agree with most of what you said, I just have a little remark. You're saying code is part of a whole. I say without the coding, there is no product. You can skip documentation, localization and still have a working product in many ways. But without the coding, there is nothing. You can't write documentation on something that doesn't exist, and you can't localize something that doesn't exist. Code is not only part of a whole, code is the central part of the whole. At least in that case. :)</p>
