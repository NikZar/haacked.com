message: <p>Well... I agree somewhat.  I mean, that's how our company is as well.  Quality is scaled back some in order to shorten the time to market.   The demand/priority for the product decides it's time to market.  I barely even get any say in when something is going to be completed, they just expect I can get it done in that time frame.  So I agree somewhat about how things really are.<br>I just don't like it :)</p>
