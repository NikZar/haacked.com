message: <p>I'm pretty lazy myself, so I think piggy-backing is a great idea. However, I have to completely disagree w/ you when it comes to the unlikelihood of someone hacking multiple accounts. The vast majority of people aren't likely to have multiple passwords, so when one account is compromised, you can pretty much consider the rest compromised as well.</p>
