message: <p>aha, good point about git Phil.  I'll buy that.  I'm still a bit weirded out about not having my dlls stored where I generally store them, in a Lib folder at the root.  I guess if I had greater insight into how packages are created, applied and so on I would be more comfortable.  That of course is on me, but it would still be nice if a published package listed what it planned to do.<br>thx<br></p>
