message: <p>Have you considered just using the advanced plan rather than the semi-dedicated? We use just the advanced to host <a href="http://www.tourneylogic.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.tourneylogic.com">http://www.tourneylogic.com</a> and have been very pleased with it. I have instructions somewhere on my blog about installing vault on webhost4life that if you're interested in, I can dig up the post for you. Just shoot me an email at jross at rosscode dot com.<br><br><br><br>And if you don't have a referrer, we'll take the referral bonus if you sign up! ;-)</p>
