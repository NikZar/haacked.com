message: <p>Mine came from a mistake where we sent out a URL with the admin session key in the URL and had a lot of admin log in at the same time. It was around 2002 and I learnt the hard way about session hijacking but it was my moment of right, I better learn how to secure these things. For some reason, we all have that oh crap, I am never making that sort of mistake again. .</p>
