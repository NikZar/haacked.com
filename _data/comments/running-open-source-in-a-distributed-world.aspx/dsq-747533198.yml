message: <p>Another way to make sure you're not missing out on this one great feature idea is to make it possible for people to do a submit once to a seperate repository. Any contributions in that repository obviously require a code review (which involves work, I know). <br>If someone posts a second piece of code to that repository, it then becomes time to discuss an agreement, as they are likely to contribute again.<br>This way you potentially have a lot less administrative work and any work you have to put in reviewing code is likely to lead to a good addition to your project.</p>
