message: <p>What I meant was I changed the code slightly to use an intermediate variable.  For example,<br><br><br><br>bool y == (x == SqlInt.Null);<br><br><br><br>That didn't compile so I tried:<br><br><br><br>object y == (x == SqlInt.Null);<br><br><br><br>Then in the debugger I checked the type of y.  Sure enough, it was SqlBoolean.</p>
