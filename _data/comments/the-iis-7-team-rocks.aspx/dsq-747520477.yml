message: <p>I'll second that the IIS team has really been all out in scouring blogs and pitching in with any issues at all! Both Bill and Mike have bailed me out a couple of times as well and posted follow ups to questions with extended blog entries which is awesome. Kudos and a big thank you to those guys!!!</p>
