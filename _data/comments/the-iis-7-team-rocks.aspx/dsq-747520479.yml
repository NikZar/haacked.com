message: <p>Oh sure.  Just show off your inside connections. Don't mind us who must suffer our Vista nightmare's in obscurity ;-)<br>I do have to commend Microsoft for spending more time in the community the last year or two.  Compared to 3 or 4 years ago, I think Microsoft has gotten more in touch with what is going on and is actively out working in the community to try and identify and solve our problems, if not always on a personal level, certainly on a global one.</p>
