message: <p>It crossed my mind yesterday but I couldn't exactly pick up a dime bag from my Green Zone dealer.  Actually, word on the street is that hashish is available but I've resisted the temptation.  I did enjoy a nargheelah (sp?) last night - the Iraqi equivalent of a hookah - but that's just tobacco.</p>
