message: <p>Ryan, the HTTP handlers are responsible for dynamically rendering links.  That way, every time you post, you don't have to create a new .aspx page. For example, the link to this post is <a href="http://haacked.com/archive/2005/05/05/2983.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://haacked.com/archive/2005/05/05/2983.aspx">http://haacked.com/archive/2005/05/05/2983.aspx</a>.<br><br><br><br>As for the privileged user idea, I really like it. We've been talking about something similar internally.</p>
