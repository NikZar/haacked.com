message: <p>Very interesting work you're planning.  I'm already doing some of this with the v0.95 as my baseline.  Maybe some of my changes could be incorproated into your version.  I plan to do a complete Enterprise Library implementation replacing some of the config options (like connection strings, managed paths, etc).</p>
