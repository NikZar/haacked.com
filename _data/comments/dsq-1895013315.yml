message: <p>It would be great if we had a way for ASP.NET apps to register scheduled tasks outside of the web app domain but <a href="http://www.filmrally.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.filmrally.com/">sandboxed</a> to only access their parent application. Kind of a safe way to allow a medium trust web app to add a windows scheduled task. Just brainstorming...</p>
