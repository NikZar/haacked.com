message: <p>"I've always found the proclaimed many-eyes advantage to Open Source bogus simply because having the people doesn't make them look. How many Firefox users look at the code?"<br>To be fair, you should characterize those numerous firefox users as "many hands" rather than "many eyes".  <br>Some of them may be looking at the code, but most of them are just waving mice and tweaking knobs.</p>
