message: <p>You've inspired me. My go-to-drink is a Whisky Sour. There are a *lot* of places that do not know how to make one or make it right. But I'm very lazy, and I haven't thought to learn the intricacies myself.</p><p>I'm also a big Makers Mark fan, but I'm no longer satisfied with a peasant Bourbon and Coke. This recipe of yours looks right up my alley.</p>
