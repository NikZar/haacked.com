message: <p>I've been using StoryQ, NUnit, and Gallio test runner as my BDD stack.

The example might be a little unorthodox, but it drives the point home. So sue me if I watch too many zombie movies.<br><a href="http://monstersgotmy.net/post/2008/08/07/Surviving-a-Zombie-Apocalypse-Behavior-Driven-Development-Part-I.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://monstersgotmy.net/post/2008/08/07/Surviving-a-Zombie-Apocalypse-Behavior-Driven-Development-Part-I.aspx">monstersgotmy.net/.../...n-Development-Part-I.aspx</a></p>
