message: <p>It may be because I'm used to reading specs written using SpecUnit and RSpec, but in the SubSpec example I find it more difficult to quickly pick up the behavior being tested. There is less noise from not having underscores in the method names, but I think once you had a project with a large number of specs you'd lose the the benefits of having the specification defined as strings due to the reduced scanability of the specs.</p>
