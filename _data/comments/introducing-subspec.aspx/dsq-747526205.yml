message: <p>It's too bad when you do a search on Bellware and BDD you find this article (which I referenced in my blog post) <a href="http://www.code-magazine.com/Article.aspx?quickid=0805061" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.code-magazine.com/Article.aspx?quickid=0805061">www.code-magazine.com/Article.aspx?quickid=0805061</a>. Can you contact Code Magazine and see if they'll change the title so as not to cause confusion?</p>
