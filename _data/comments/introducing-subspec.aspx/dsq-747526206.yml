message: <p>Phil,<br>&gt; Can you contact Code Magazine and see if they'll change the<br>&gt; title so as not to cause confusion?<br>I'll be seeing the editor of the magazine this weekend, but before I ask him, do you think that a print magazine with co-publication on the web tend to look favorably on revising web content once it has gone to print?<br>This article went to print a few days before I had my conversation with Dan about the namespace, and the differences and similarities in our respective methodologies.</p>
