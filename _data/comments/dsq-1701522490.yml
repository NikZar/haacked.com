message: <p>I see you have a butchered version of the over-sized label on the Angostura bitters. It is supposed to be over-sized :-) Manhattan is an excellent cocktail (my signature too). I prefer it with Noilly Prat and a Canadian Rye Whiskey. Finish the glass with a bit of orange peel for some added flavor intensity. Delicious!</p>
