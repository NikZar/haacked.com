message: <p>Hi,<br>I'm looking forward to learning about your alternative approaches to the 'dirty' RenderComponent technique.  There is certainly a need to incorporate a mechanism to separate out chunks of V-C so that composable pages do not end up with a mega controller.<br>Note also that moving this to Futures contradicts your earlier statement that 'If we implement something we are pretty sure we have no intention of including in the framework, weâ€™ll typically post it as a blog sample or something to that effect.' (as opposed to putting it in Futures)<br>Best wishes,<br>Adam.</p>
