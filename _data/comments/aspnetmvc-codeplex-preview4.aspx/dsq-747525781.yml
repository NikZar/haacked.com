message: <p>Hey Phil, great stuff! Any views (no pun intended) on the best way to go from P3 to P4? Doesn't look like the MSI likes the fact that we've got P3 installed - any easy way to move all the test sites I've created with P3 to P4?<br>If not - oh well, time to roll up those sleeves!<br>cheers,<br>Rob G</p>
