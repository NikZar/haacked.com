message: <p>Not great in IE7. When viewing individual pages (not the home page), the "blogpost" section almost always has vertical and horizontal scrollbars, depending on the width of the window. It's not a problem in IE6 or Firefox, so it may just be that I never noticed it before.<br>What's really odd is the XFN link doesn't move when you scroll, so it can end up on top of the text...</p>
