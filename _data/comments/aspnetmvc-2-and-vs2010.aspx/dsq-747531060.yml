message: <p>Great post to clarify the situation and let us peer into the development cycle of the MVC team.<br>One real concern though, by not having the tooling included in any of the betas aren't you losing valuable testing / customer feedback on the tooling itself?  This is assuming that there are new features &amp; changes to the tooling for this release.</p>
