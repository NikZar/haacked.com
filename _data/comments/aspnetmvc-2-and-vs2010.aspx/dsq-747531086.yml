message: <p>Can't wait to see new VS. 2010 version will include (I hope) many useful tools to use. Sometimes the first look brings a conclusion that new version is not so revolutionary to resign from using the old one but I think that after some time of working with the new application, all the new includes will be appreciated.</p>
