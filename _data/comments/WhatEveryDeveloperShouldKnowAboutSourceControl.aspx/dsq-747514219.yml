message: <p>I hate, hate, HATE, SourceSafe's integration with VS.NET. We used to do this at work and it caused nothing but sync issues, ugly VSS directory structures, and just pain in general. Using the two products separately has been fine, but combining them is kind of like ammonia and bleach.</p>
