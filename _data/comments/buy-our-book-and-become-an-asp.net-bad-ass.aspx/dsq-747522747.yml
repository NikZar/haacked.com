message: "<p>As Simone said, there's not a whole lot of new stuff for ASP.NET in 3.0 and 3.5. The book has a whole chapter on AJAX (by K. Scott Allen - one of the best chapters).<br>There are new things it doesn't cover: Linq and the ListView.<br>However, this is a problem / solution book, not a list of what's new in the language. There are possibly some minor updates which could be made, but there's nothing really substantial that would change with .NET 3.5.</p>"
