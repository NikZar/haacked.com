message: <p>Webhost4life is doing good for me.  Had a outage few months back but they fixed it very quickly.  Support is fast. I can't say that they always fix the problem with one try, but at least I can get a respond from them within few minutes and usually fix the problem with no longer than an hour.  I tried Godaddy and 1and1 in the past and what's what I call CRAPPY support service.  Besides that, I don't see what's wrong with webhost4life and they price is the best I found so far for the kind of space they give for MSSQL.</p>
