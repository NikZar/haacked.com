message: <p>This will be my 3rd year with WebHost4Life.  Lately the service has gone to hell--I too have had 4 outages in 7 days.  Seems they have over sold their MySQL capacity.  For the most part I have been satisfied with the price of the services compared with the level of support.  But lately there have just been too many crashes.  What sucks is the months before I reupped for another year things work great.  A few weeks after paying and I am having to open daily tickets to point out the MySQL server is down.<br>Anyone have any recommendations for reliable, low-cost hosting?</p>
