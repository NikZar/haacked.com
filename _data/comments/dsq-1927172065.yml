message: <p>The real problem arises when there is nothing distinguishing urgent from trivial. Most are trivial, which should be easy enough to flag or use delayed delivery emails for, but I find most managers do not.</p><p>It grows worse if the manager doesn't know what is trivial and what isn't, but there's no salvaging that sort of management.</p>
