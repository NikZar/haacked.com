message: <p>Well said, Phil.  As for democracy working, it does not work when we have politically-controlled gerrymandering and voter-suppression that slants election results against the popular vote -- twice in the last 5 elections.. Trump IS our President, but that just means that we citizens must be vigilant and stand up for the checks and balances, and facts, that Trump seeks to undermine.  "'So-called' judges", anyone?</p>
