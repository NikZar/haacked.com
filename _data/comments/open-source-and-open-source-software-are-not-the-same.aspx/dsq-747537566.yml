message: <p>@Peter - The roadmap was posted back in July '11 and looks quite a bit like what was in the Developer Preview that came out in September. The Web API features that were added in started under WCF Web API with Glenn Block, and couldn't have been more in the open.<br> <br>If you look at the responses - both on UserVoice (view completed) and comments on the roadmap, there's been a lot of focus on requests - e.g. bundling and minification.</p>
