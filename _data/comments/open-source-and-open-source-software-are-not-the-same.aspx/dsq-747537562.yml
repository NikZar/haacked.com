message: <p>Is it just me or was MVC4 developed in "secrecy" -- at least compared to previous versions? Seems like the walls have closed and it's really like Phil put it "throwing the end result over the fence". There are so many small issues that should be fixed, but the attitude seems to be to ignore everything and march on with whatever they think is best. Most issues in the uservoice Phil set up seem to have been ignored... What is going on?</p>
