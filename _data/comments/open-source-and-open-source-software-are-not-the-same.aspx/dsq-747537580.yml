message: <p>Because "Shared Source" means something very different. Did you see the Wikipedia link to "Shared Source"? Contrast that with the Open Source Definition or the Wikipedia post on open source software.<br>The defintion for OSS is well established. Why do you think "Shared Source" would be clearer when this software clearly does not meet that definition but does meet the OSD?<br></p>
