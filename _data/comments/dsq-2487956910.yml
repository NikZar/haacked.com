message: <p>Thanks Phil, but one thing that was taken away from the original was the relative state of the Origin next to the "Sync" button.  For example it used to show how many commits the local was ahead and/or behind. When can we get that back?  The lack of it causes unnecessary clicks on Sync just to check.</p>
