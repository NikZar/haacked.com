message: <p>Hi, this sounds like an ideal tool for some refactoring work which is coming up. (Hope this hasn't been asked already) When do you envisage the move from beta might happen as this makes it a difficult sell in some work places? Would love to help out but not sure what would be the best place to start in terms of work that's required by the project?</p>
