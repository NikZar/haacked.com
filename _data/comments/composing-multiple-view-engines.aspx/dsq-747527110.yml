message: <p>That is cool. It makes the decision to adopt a particular view engine not such a huge deal. For example you might write some pieces in nhaml and then discover down the track that it would be easier/more flexible/better to write other pieces in webformsview. I've not used nhaml but it would be interesting to try it, i like the concept.<br></p>
