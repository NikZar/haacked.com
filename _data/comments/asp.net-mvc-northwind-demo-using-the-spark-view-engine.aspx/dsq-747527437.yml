message: <p>I dont like on Spark that it is really hard to find the template code between the html attributes. I think it must be more clear what is template and what is html.<br>But here is the NHaml example :-)<br>%ul.products<br>  - foreach( var product in ViewData.Model )<br>%li=product.ProductName</p>
