message: <p>Apparently someone responded to one of these "Spanish Prisoner" e-mails, and put a website up showing the results of various "tests" he put "Laurent Kabila" through.  For example, requiring him to send a picture with a recent copy of the New York times to prove that the e-mail was current.  Unfortunately, I don't have the URL.</p>
