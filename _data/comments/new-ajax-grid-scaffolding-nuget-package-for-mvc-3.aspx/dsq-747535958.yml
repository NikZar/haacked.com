message: <p>Make the controller RESTful to make interaction with other stuff easy and you are on to a winner. If you added the option of a choice between returning JSON or PartialViews it would be very helpful. Even if we just had a scaffolder to implement RESTful json controller/repositories it would be extremely useful and encourage best practice!</p>
