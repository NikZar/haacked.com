message: <p>Really nice...(and really Phil, you commenting on proper english usage ;)). I do wonder if you're not duplicating work already done on stuff like jqGrid...it has way more functionality (obviously being an older product), would it not be worthwhile exploiting the investment MVC already made in jQuery and expanding that to some of the preexisting controls?<br>Oh, and for the guy commenting on interns...ASP.NET interns ain't 'normal' interns...as a general rule they're 99th+ percentile devs :)</p>
