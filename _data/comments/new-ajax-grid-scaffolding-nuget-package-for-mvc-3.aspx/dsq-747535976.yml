message: <p>@Carsten<br>Do the <code>&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;s</code> genertated by the <code>GridData</code> partial view contain a <code>data-pkey</code> attribute? If not, the scaffolder either found more than one column in the primary key (something which I hope we will support in the future) or didn't find a primary key at all.</p>
