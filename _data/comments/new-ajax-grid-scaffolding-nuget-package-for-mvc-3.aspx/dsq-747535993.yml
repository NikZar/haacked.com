message: <p>We need an excellent grid within an MVC that can beat the control vendors :-) of course they won't be happy but making it native to any offering is what makes it kind of better choice for enterprises, since no one wants to bind themselves to control vendors these days.<br>nice work, and will be waiting for the grid release that can be used heavily in financial industries in MVC 4.</p>
