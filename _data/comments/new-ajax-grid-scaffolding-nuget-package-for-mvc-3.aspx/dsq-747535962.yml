message: <p>@Scott Galloway I get your point about jqGrid, but IMO it's heavy, clunky, and just plain ugly. If only the jQuery UI Grid was ready, huh?<br>To those who are commenting about interns; I'm sure DevDiv would not just hand a project over to be solely worked on by an intern. I'm sure the intern will be working in a team, and having to follow the same quality processes as the rest of the team.<br>A good intern program is one where adequate attention is given to the intern and what they're doing; not one in which the intern is given a task to complete by themselves and then abandoned. I mean the whole point of an intern program is to get real-world experience, and in DevDiv that will involve being a part of a product team, following processes including code reviews and design phases.</p>
