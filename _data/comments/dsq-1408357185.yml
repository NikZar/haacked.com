message: <p>Open source and more generally free software is not about moving liability of maintaining whole software to each and every user. It is about _letting_ people change that annoying little piece of code that makes their OS and their APP incompatible at some point. Instead of forcing them to forego either the former or the latter (or more frequently both of them at the same time). All closed source software is just a cage, that you get into believing, that the cage owner won't close doors behind you somewhere in the future.<br>I'm not willing to offence anyone, but for me it looks funny how people try to resolve problems that shouldn't exist at all in the first place. On the other side it is sad, how people waste their time struggling with obstacles brought to them by others - in the name of making business.</p>
