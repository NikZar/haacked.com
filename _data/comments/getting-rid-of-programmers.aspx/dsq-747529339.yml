message: <p>Not to nit-pick, but The Mythical Man-Month did not originally contain No Silver Bullet.  Oh, it's in there now, but NSB dates from 1986, while TMMM dates from 1976.<br>I guess I care because it gives perspective to how long these ideas have been around and how, sadly, we haven't learned.<br>Great post.</p>
