message: <p>@haacked Don't get me wrong.  Programmers are not the only people at fault when it comes to failing software projects!  All the cogs need to look hard at the value they add.<br>I also 100% agree that experienced programmers have a responsibility to encourage and mentor others.  However, any given project MUST be staffed with people that have the appropriate capabilities.  <br>The "let's chuck a random mix of .NET generalists at the project" school of thought still seems way to prevalent to me.</p>
