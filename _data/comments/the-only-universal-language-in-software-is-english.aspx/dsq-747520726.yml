message: <p>@Jon Limjap No. The proper term is American English. There is a reason that the following URL redirects to American English.<br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/En-US" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/En-US">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/En-US</a><br>If someone wants to say something in it's full name, don't correct them with abbreviations. If I say "I'll be right back, I've got to head to the store." I'd hope that you wouldn't correct me with "brb, g2g store".<br>Same basic concept.</p>
