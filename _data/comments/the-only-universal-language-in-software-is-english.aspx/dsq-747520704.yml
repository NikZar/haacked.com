message: <p>One thing to consider is that if you aren't a native english speaker you don't speak or even think in the same manner as a native speaker. I've worked with several developers that weren't native english speakers and they did code differently. I remember reading somewhere that Ruby written by Japanese is very different than the Ruby written by Americans. There may be one Universal Language, there there are numerous dialects.</p>
