message: <p>After going through the stuff with the lawyer, finacial advisor and whatnot, I would:<br>Buy my parents and my sister with her two kids a house(duh.). Not a over-the-top, fancy shmancy house. A nice, comfortable, beautiful house. Then:<br>Get a place of my own. <br>A car<br>Go back to school and not worry bout the cost of books, etc. figure out my future from there. :D<br>Maybe travel a bit<br>Donate some to charity<br>And the rest I'll save for the future.</p>
