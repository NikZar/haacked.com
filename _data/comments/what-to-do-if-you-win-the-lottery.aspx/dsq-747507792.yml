message: <p>I would buy a Livery Farm with hotel on site, run a business for Horse holidays with riding schools, gym and sauna, swimming pool and free riding for disabled children.  I would also set up an account for my 5 children for their college/university fees. I would hire a limo to collect my personnal belongings from my old small house to p**s off my ex-neighbours (lmfao).  Employ some rather nice hunky men to help in the stables, hotel, gym, swimming pool MMMMMMMMMM. shop shop shop and more shopping.</p>
