message: <p>Even just the dream makes me feel better; if only for a short while! First I would show my gratitude to those members of my family which have shown me great support during the times of my cancer and then divorce by paying off their mortgages or giving them enough cash to buy a home. I would love homes on the coast of both the Atlantic and Pacific; large enough for family and friends to visit. I would take everyone on a cruise with me, make sure my grandchildren have enough for college and my grown children if they want to further their education or buy businesses.  I really liked that idea of a personal trainer!</p>
