message: <p>this is no jokes what i would do:<br>build a luxurious 5 star resort on the coast of Mexico's beautiful Los Cabos.<br>Then, i would quit my job, live on-site, drink all day, and drive around in a golf cart saying hi to all my guests and employees and being the coolest manager ever.  Also, i'd tip my employees hundred dollar bills, and id wear silly golf attire and be a goofy frat boy again!</p>
