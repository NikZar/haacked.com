message: <p>Wasn't it Jesus that said the Love of money is the root of all evil?  No not money but the love of money.  To win is good because it is a blessing but being a good steward of that money is better.  I read several articles that stated if you invest the money you spend on lottery tickets you can actually make more than if you played and never won.  What are the chances of winning.  Okay Okay.... I would live life like I live it now.  Instead of teaching for money I would volunteer at schools since many of them do not have enough qualified teachers.  I also agree with those that said if anyone came asking for money....I would have to so sorry no can do.  You never know what is in that person's heart.  I do like the recommendations done by the CFP.  Good Luck to all of you and may you accomplish your dreams.</p>
