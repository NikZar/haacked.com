message: <p>Here's what I would do and you may want to copy and paste this....DONT sign the lottery ticket. make 6 copies of ticket at kinkos when no one is looking. open a safe deposit box at my bank and take several papers their so as not to let tellers see what I am putting in my safe deposit box. I would go to thet largest law firm in my state,why? well because you know if they're the largest law firm in your state then you know that they are the most reputable. I will ask to speak to the partners or jr partners, and either have them reccommend their best lawyers or deal with my case directly. Once thats settled we get a blind trust, so I can claim money anonymously. Pay off all bills and debt. Set up a will and trust for tax purposes with the help of lawyers and accountants and law firm. ALSO,  strategize business and investments with the firm.Relax. Splurge a little......<br>Buy me a tax lien or forclosed condo out santa barbara california,buy a salvaged rolls royce and restore it with a GM engine. a Roadtrek 210 RV, and buy my mom tax lien or forclosed  house. Total splurge bill estimate $1,000,000. Everything else is tied up in businesses.<br>Ultimate goal would be to find me my wonder woman and live in costa rica like a king.</p>
