message: <p>When I hit the lotto, I would first buy nice new house, buy nice car and suv. Pay off my credit cards, student loan. I would also pay of my parent's house and give them $250,000. And I would buy my brother new house and give him some cash.  And I would hire fiancial advisor and lawyer to invest my money. I would buy land, building, like shopping plaza for investment purpose. I would build or buy a new church for my church congregation. I would not change, my life style will change.</p>
