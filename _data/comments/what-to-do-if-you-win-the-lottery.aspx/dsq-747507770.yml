message: <p>If I won the lottery, I would buy my younger brother a new home with a couple of acres where he could keep his goats.  I am sure that he would love that too much.  Then I would see to it that my older sister had the medical help she THINKS she needs.  After that i would breathe easier because then I could devote myself to doing what I truely love to do.  Help women become healthier with nutrition &amp; exercise.</p>
