message: <p>Hah! MTA objects are as if you wrapped every method in a class with "Dispatcher.Invoke(theRealObject.ThatMethod())" - calls are automatically sent to the correct thread, then the result is returned to the caller. At first, it seems like that'd be super convenient, but it's cruise-control for deadlocks and threading issues.</p>
