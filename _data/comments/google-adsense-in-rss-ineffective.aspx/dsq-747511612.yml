message: <p>Part of it has to do with conservation.  You see we live in Los Angeles and bought our little condo.  Little in size, hefty in price.  It cost so much we had to promise our firstborn as a DOWNPAYMENT.<br><br><br><br>So we try to save money in every other way possible so we can buy the poor kid back before he/she heads off to highschool.</p>
