message: <p>Congratulations Phil, that's a big decision and I'm sure it will be the start of many great things in your future.  It was a pleasure to meet you in your official Microsoft capacity at the MVP summit, and I hope our paths cross again in the future. Many Thanks for all the blog posts from the 'official' side of .NET and here's to many more from the outside.<br>Best of luck in life and your new role.</p>
