message: <p>Thanks for all of your work on ASP.NET MVC.  It was (and still is) a game changer on the Microsoft platform.  On my first ASP.NET MVC project I slashed my estimates in half from what they were on previous WebForms projects... and later I had to cut them in half again.  For that I owe you a beer if I ever meet you in person!</p>
