message: <p>Regardless of what your cover letter or resume look like, the sad truth in the job market is it's not what you know, it's WHO you know.  Over 80% of all jobs are filled through networking.......regardless of your education or past work experience.  But I will have to say that I do get a kick out of seeing resumes with petty typos that should have been caught.  :)</p>
