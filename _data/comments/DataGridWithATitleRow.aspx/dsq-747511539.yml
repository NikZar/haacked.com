message: <p>Interesting article, first time i've seen use of the 'SetRenderMethodDelegate' method, must investigate.<br>Did you try using the Caption attribute of the DataGrid for this purpose? It doesn't create a cell as such, but it does create a fully stylable tag for the table, more semantically correct for those buffs too.</p>
