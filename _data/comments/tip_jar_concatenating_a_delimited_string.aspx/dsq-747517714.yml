message: <p>I feel your pain!<br>I've actually used Join in both C# and Javascript for some code I wrote for manipulating the CSS Styles of a DOM element. It's nice to deal with the styles as an array, but when added back to the element, they need to be a single string with each Style separated by a space (" ").<br>Anyhow, good Tip!</p>
