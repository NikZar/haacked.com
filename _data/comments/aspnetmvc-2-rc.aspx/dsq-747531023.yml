message: <p>@Eilon Lipton<br>What is, please, a version number of the RC DLL?<br>Also, as far as I know, I can still develop an application in VS10Beta2 and manually reference the new RC DLL? Or it will not compile within .NET 4 at all?<br>If I already have VS2010Beta 2 installed, I have to remove it to install MVC2 RC?</p>
