message: <p>@Haacked and @Eilon,<br>Please keep up the good work! And whatever you do, DO NOT let all the silly questions about having the team support every possible VS Beta in lieu of shipping bits or diverge from your current release process. I really dont understand why you guys receive the same question time and time again. <br>Again, keep up the great work. Some of us understand :)<br>Eddy</p>
