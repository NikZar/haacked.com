message: <p>@simon stuff like this is why the publishing industry is doomed. I think they are as clueless as the music industry. <br>I just bought a 4 book set print copy of game of thrones for $16. I can sell the books when I'm done reading them. Or give them away to a friend.<br>The kindle version was $40...</p>
