message: <p>@haacked What happened to the Kindle edition???  I only buy tech/programming books either in eBook (Kindle) or PDF format because it's much easier to read &amp; code the tutorials at the same time! Especially with a dual monitor setup.<br>Why is the Kindle edition not available? Please make it available, pretty please!</p>
