message: <p>Dear Phill, please correct me if I'm wrong, but JavaScript arrays are not JSON. I mean, JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation (yeah, I known you know it, just emphasis ;)). So, it's literally a notation for JavaScript objects, not JavaScript arrays. In other words, JSON should start with {, not [.</p>
