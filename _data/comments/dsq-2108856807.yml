message: <p>Since I've already forced wrong-branch back to origin/wrong-branch, checking it out means I don't have access to the commits between wrong-branch and new-branch.</p><p>So "git rebase --onto master wrong-branch" is saying migrate the commits between wrong-branch and HEAD (aka new-branch) onto master.</p>
