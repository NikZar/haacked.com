message: <p>For me a reason to contribute to opensource would only be for commercial reasons. By this I mean, that I would use an opensource project in a project of my own and then if there is a problem that gets in my way I'd fix it (if it's not to hard, that is).<br>I think the key here is to make fixing problems as easy as it can be, especially with the check-in process.</p>
