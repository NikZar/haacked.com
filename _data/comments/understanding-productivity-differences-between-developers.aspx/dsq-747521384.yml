message: <p>The guy who is 28 times more productive doesn't need to be paid 28 times more than the dimwit in the next cubicle. <br>The super productive guy is having a lot more fun than the dimwit. The dimwit guy finds it hard to even get up in the morning and go to work. <br>The super productive guy is having a blast! Money is secondary.</p>
