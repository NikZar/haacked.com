message: <p>You missed some of the additional research.  While *individuals* can vary in productivity by 28 times, *teams* vary by a much smaller amount.  It's one of those "the wisdom of crowds" things.  In the end, it's still about putting the best *team* together unless you are trying to be a one-man show - which will only work for the smallest of applications.</p>
