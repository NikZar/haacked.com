message: <p>Thanks for drawing attention to this phenomenon, and particularly the existence of "interchangeable engineer" syndrome, in which the manager feels free to shuffle his people around, assign anything to anybody, and make them work multiple projects at the same time (hey, how about 10 hours a week on these four projects?  OK?).</p><p>I have also observed that some people spend a week coding and a month debugging it, whereas the guy next to him would spend one day *designing* it, four days coding, and two days debugging.</p>
