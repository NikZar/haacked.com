message: <p>I wasn't able to install NuPack.Server on IIS 7 on a Windows 2008 box - web deployment failed w/ various errors, I tried everything and the kitchen sink and couldn't make this work. Is there *anyone* who was able to deploy the server to provide a local repository at his company? TIA, Stoyan</p>
