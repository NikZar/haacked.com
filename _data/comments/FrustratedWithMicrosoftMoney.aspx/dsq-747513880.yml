message: <p>This same problem has been annoying me for months.<br>I fixed it by clicking on the Check MSN Network Status in Money. This opened a website basically reminding me that after 2 years you cannot access online banking without an upgrade. This is out of the question as I run W2K.<br>Anyway, there was a certificate you could download and install. I did that, and now it works again....<br></p>
