message: <p>@Haacked:<br>Well we've stopped feeding our employees, that's how we keep them 'Lean.' Insted we spend the money on power Yoga to make them more 'Agile.' We also introduced a team 'Rugby' team. Scrum didn't go down well. Next year I'll find a new way of treating everyone like they've got sh*t for brains. I'm watching the engineering industry very closely for ideas.</p>
