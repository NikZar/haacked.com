message: <p>I love stories like that. I've certainly had my share. My kid has some sensory issues, so he gets kind of rough at times, which generally leads to me getting hit in the nuts. This apparently made some impression on him, as just the other day, at Walt Disney World, he tripped getting into a ride and declared to the operator, "That hurt my balls!"</p>
