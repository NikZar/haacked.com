message: <p>I know there have been big changes in IIS7, but it concerns me a bit that the web.config file has to be different compared to IIS6. As the change from IIS6 to 7 occurs, there's sure to be some grief. Sorry for the non-MVC comment, but this is the first time I've grokked this as a possibility.</p>
