message: <p>Hi Phil,<br>I am now downloading mvc 3 rc and I am considering to develop a web application with mcv 3 rc and I will probably use that app on production. I am guessing that I can easily upgrade that app when the mvc 3 rtm is released. What is your opinion on that? <br>thank you and your team for this such an enourmous framework !</p>
