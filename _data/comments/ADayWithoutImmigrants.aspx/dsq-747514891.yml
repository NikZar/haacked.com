message: <p>Wow Phil,<br>This post stirred quite a bit of debate.  Its good to see your Oxy roots showing up in the comment "I respect that many will disagree with me vehemently on the issue of immigration".  Is there a difference between respecting (e.g. understanding) that people disagree, and respecting their opinions?<br>Here is Seattle, I high-tailed it out of downtown before the protest started to avoid hour long delays at the bus stop.<br>Walter</p>
