message: <p>Wow... that demo is pretty sweet.<br>I do have to admit that I am a sucker for free (as in both speech and beer) stuff, but that <a href="http://www.maxivista.com/multi_monitor.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.maxivista.com/multi_monitor.htm">Desktop Extension</a> feature of MaxiVista is just too damn cool. I would be able to bring my [work] laptop home, hook up to the [wireless] LAN and immediatly extend my desktop.<br>Hmm, I think I'll certainly give the free trial a shot, and see if it's worth the $35.<br></p>
