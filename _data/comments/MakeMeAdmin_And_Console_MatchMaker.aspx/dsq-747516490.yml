message: <p>My laptop is off being repaired. When it returns, I am going to do a fresh install. I am seriously considering trying this again.<br>The biggest hurdle, for me, are the two programs I use regularly; Chief Architect and QuickBooks. QB is horrible at requiring Admin priveleges.<br>Hopefully it will work out ok.</p>
