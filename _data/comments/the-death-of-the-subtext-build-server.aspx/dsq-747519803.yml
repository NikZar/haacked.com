message: <p>This is precisely as to why all of my machines are on a UPS.  I have to UPS units under my desk. One's a 1300VA and the other's a 700VA for the smaller devices.  Both are SmartUPS's, meaning they'll correct for the under and over voltages which can occur.  My wife's computer is also on a 900 VA UPS.  Heck, even my home theater system is on a 1500VA SmartUPS.  It's well worth the extra cost.</p>
