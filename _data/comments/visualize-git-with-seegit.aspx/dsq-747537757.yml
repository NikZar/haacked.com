message: <p>Typical, I've been building the exact same app myself for a talk I'm giving on DVCS next month :). Yours looks much nicer than min though, and I'll have to check out GraphSharp's layout algorihms, as my own layout algorithm is very poor. I might even contribute Mercurial support as my app can do that.<br>There does seem to be a performance issue with the latest version. The graph for Code52/carnac took forever to load, and was impossible to zoom.<br>Still, very excited by this project</p>
