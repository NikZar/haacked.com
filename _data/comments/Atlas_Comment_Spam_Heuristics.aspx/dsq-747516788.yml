message: <p>I was looking at this control last night and found two potential problems.<br>1) The sample thinks I'm a bot when I used the back button and hit submit again.  The javascript function is not called when the user clicks the back button.<br>2) If I'm a bot writer, I can adapt the response to put in a sleep that's more than a few seconds to mimic a human.</p>
