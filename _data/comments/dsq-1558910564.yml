message: <p>I think the model is pretty interesting. I agree with the people who say that finding actual market rates will be difficult. I also think that there are people who are exceptional and you should find a way to compensate them more. Going past that though, in a market of increasing pay for a given job, the employees would be happy. However...<br>If market salaries are decreasing, employees will be very unhappy. I'm not sure what to do about that.</p>
