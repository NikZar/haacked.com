message: <p>Enjoy your visit on Iceland! English Pub is really great place and you should definitively try to play roulette there. The Blue Lagoon is astonishing place. I can't forget the color of the water and the contrast it makes with the country around. I regret this event didn't happen through summer when I was on a vacation on Iceland.</p>
