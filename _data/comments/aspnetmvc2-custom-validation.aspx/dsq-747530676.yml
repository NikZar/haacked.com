message: <p>I have a viewmodel for Contact, which has a nested type Address.<br>Address type has required fields AddressLine1, ZipCode, City, State.<br>Is there any way to annotate Contact viewmodel, so that the address fields get validated as required only if Address property of Contact is marked required?<br></p>
