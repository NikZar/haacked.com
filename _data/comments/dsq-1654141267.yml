message: <p>I do love an Old Fashioned, although I've only ordered them when I've been out, not tried to make one myself. A local small bar does a particular awesome variation called the Kraken Old Fashioned made with Kraken spiced rum. Haven't tried a Manhattan but I probably should based on this article!</p><p>On the Scotch front I'm currently enjoying a bottle of Aberlour 10-year old which I heard described as "the best single malt you can get for such a reasonable price", and it's certainly very good!</p>
