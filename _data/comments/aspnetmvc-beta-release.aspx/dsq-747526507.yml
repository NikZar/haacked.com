message: <p>Nice one! The list of enhancements looks great.<br>I especially like the "Add View" menu in VS. That's far nicer than getting people to edit the code-behind file for strongly-typed views.<br>Looking forward to the RTM! Are you going to give us any hints about the other tooling enhancements you're considering?</p>
