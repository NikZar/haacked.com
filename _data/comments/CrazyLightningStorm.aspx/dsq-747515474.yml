message: <p>Over the past week or so we've had some crazy t-storms here as well. I live within spitting distance of all the tall buildings downtown, and one of them got struck...it was so close that the hair on my arms stood on end and my ears rang just before the strike. It was the loudest sound I've ever heard. I just about sh*t myself. Also had a case of the "after club" ears for a good 60 seconds.<br>My guy is terrified of thunder...runs in the closet everytime a storm pops up.</p>
