message: <p>It's time you Americans learned how to get the date right, spell words like "colour" correctly and to pronounce "tomato" the way God intended. And why do you drive on the wrong side of the road? :)<br>Seriously, can't you use a culture invariant format for dates and times? "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss" (24 hour, no days of the week, numeric months, no am/pm nonsense etc) should do the trick.</p>
