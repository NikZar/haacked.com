message: <p>Can someone explain what the big deal behind the requirement to put that attribute above the controller methods is?  Is there some valid design aspect that you can make a good point on or is this just the fact that developers are too lazy to put a simple attribute on a method?  Which is it here?  Is it a matter of just sickening nerd coders that have nothing to do or is there more behind the problem of simply having to include a lousy attribute on a method.  I mean someone please explain this "problem" to me cause I don't get it.</p>
