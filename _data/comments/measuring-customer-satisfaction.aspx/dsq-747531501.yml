message: <p>I'm a big fan of immediate feedback and I like the idea to give to the users some intruments to express their opinions and make them feel that they are listened. I like put an informal rudimental rating system  directly inside the 'About' dialog and possibly show in real time the number of downloads to build up a sense of community. I envision a (possible not) introusive way where customers can rate single features directly inside the software, or at least prepare a special 'beta' version with the feedback process directly engraved in my projects</p>
