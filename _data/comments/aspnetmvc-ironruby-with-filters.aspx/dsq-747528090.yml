message: <p>I'm not much into Ruby myself, but this does seem interesting. The more interesting part, however, is how you mention action and controller descriptors. I had worked with them just before you mentioned them on this post, and recently I've made a post of my own about them ( <a href="http://wc4f.qsh.es/archive/2009/02/19/6.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://wc4f.qsh.es/archive/2009/02/19/6.aspx">http://wc4f.qsh.es/archive/2009/02/19/6.aspx</a> ).  I do look forward to more posts about the extensibility of ASP.NET MVC from both you and ScottGu.</p>
