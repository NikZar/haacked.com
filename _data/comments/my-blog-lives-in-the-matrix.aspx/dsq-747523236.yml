message: <p>Perf is so transient but your site will live forever.  Ok... maybe not YOUR site Phil... but definitely Jeff's.  Anyway think of this;  next year when they get the brand new extra beefy server with cheese, it is a simple xcopy and one or two tweaks in the VM host and your whole site is on a new box with nary a gif or a .config out of place.  Virtual machines - the ultimate zip file.</p>
