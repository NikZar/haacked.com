message: <p>I'm not too excited. I understand you want to be somewhat opinionated, but you can keep tweaking project templates as long as you want and not satisfy a lot of people. Seems like a job for the community to come up with cool project templates, be it HTML5 ready templates, or Silverlight optimized templates or whatever.<br></p>
