message: <p>A little confusion. I held back on installing MVC3 but after @shanselman's demo I thought I'd try.<br>Went to <a href="http://asp.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://asp.net">http://asp.net</a>, then to MVC, and clicked that itty bitty link for those of us who already have VS installed. The link is labeled "MVC 3". That downloaded AspNetMVC3ToolsUpdateSetup.exe. Spent 45 minutes letting that install. When done I was shocked (shocked!) that VS was still only offering me MVC2. :-(<br>How does one actually get this MVC3 goodness?<br></p>
