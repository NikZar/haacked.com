message: <p>Phil,<br>Thanks for the update with some cool new  features.<br>I have installed the update on serveral VS2010 Premium environments. However on one machine the syntax highlighting and intellisense do not work anymore after the update. Repairing SP1, uninstalling MVC3 and installing it again did not work.<br>Any ideas what to do to fix it?<br>Thanks.</p>
