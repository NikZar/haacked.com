message: <p>I like this idea.  On a site of mine that attracts spam submits, upon detecting spam I delay responding for 30 seconds before returning a "successful" submit and ignore the input.  I'm not sure if the bots actually wait for a response, but I throw in a delay for good measure.<br><br></p>
