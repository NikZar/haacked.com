message: <p>Interesting idea no doubt. But I think I've heard similar ideas in some other forums. The best part about it is its simplicity. One of the simplest to implement and effective too.<br>I wonder how long will it take for the bots to have a full CSS renderer? .... conceptually it isn't that difficult. But I guess that day is far off due to its effectiveness. A majority of sites would have to implement this strategy, for the bots to have a full fledged renderer. Till then this will prove to be an effective strategy for sure.</p>
