message: <p>One of the problems that I ran into using this method is Google's "Autofill" button on the tool bar.  I named my hidden field "EmailSomething" and the Google Toolbard "Autofill" fills it in, even though it cannot be seen.  I realize this may not be showstopper, but just something you may want to be aware of when using it on Contact forms.</p>
