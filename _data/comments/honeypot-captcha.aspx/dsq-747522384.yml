message: <p>A while ago I was spam comments on a site. I added a honeypot plus a hashed timestamp in an input hidden. If the form is submitted less than 3 seconds after the generation of the page, chances are pretty high that it is a bot. I also check for the number of URLs in the comment and if a domain's URL is already in my blacklist.<br>The amount of spam dropped drastically.</p>
