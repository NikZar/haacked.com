message: <p>See, my ego was wrong again. ;)<br>I see your point though and agree.  I have absolutely no interest in Origami.  Many viral marketing campaigns suck. I prefer word-of-mouth campaigns based on the actual product, not the hype.  Like Flickr, I love it.<br>The only reason I'm interested in On10 is that my friends are excited about it and they worked on it.  I think that's cool. But if it sucks, that'll make for an awkward beer conversation. ;)<br>You're not the first person to challenge me about being an independent voice. A friend asked me how I could have advertising and be truly independent.  As I pointed out, since I don't know specifically who is advertising on my blog (it's chosen algorithmically), there's just no real way for it to affect my writing.  <br>I have no problem complaining about Google's support of a repressive regime by stifling search results in China.  See?<br>In any case, keep up the good fight.</p>
