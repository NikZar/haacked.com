message: <p>Honestly, I don't know why we started passing around the pregnant woman image.  It was funny when we used it internally, but I thought that's where it would stop.  But whatever...I was more talking about the videos.  Sorry you're not interested.  Or is it more that you're sick of this type of "viral marketing" or whatever you want to call it?</p>
