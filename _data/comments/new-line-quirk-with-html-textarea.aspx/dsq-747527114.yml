message: <p>Phil, <br>Question on the subject of helpers and markup. I just noticed yesterday that in passing a string like "<span>Home</span>" into html.actionLink it gets encoded.<br>Any alternatives other than using straight html. A CSS template I am trying to use need "li,a,span" (not sure if angle brackets work in your comments) in that order.</p>
