message: <p>Interesting timing, Eric Lippert recently questioned the definition of duck-typing in his blog. I found it interesting in that you mention what you feel is a proper way to perform duck-type assertions while Eric mentions that the very definition of duck-typing can be different from developer to developer (or language to language). Kind of neat to see two well informed perspectives intersect.</p><p><a href="http://ericlippert.com/2014/01/02/what-is-duck-typing/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://ericlippert.com/2014/01/02/what-is-duck-typing/">http://ericlippert.com/2014...</a></p>
