message: <p>Hey Phil,<br>I like your point of view - one thing that should be clear after reading that is that there must an enormous amount of high opinionated developers (eg. BlogFlamers) circulating the development community.<br>You only really have to read somebody like Joel's blog to see how ridiculous most comments are - empty of anything but negative attitude and completely out of context.<br>One aspiration I personally have is to run a company well, and as Joel is able to, blog and attract that level of interest.<br>In a cut n' paste world if you're right, you're successful..simple as that...he runs his company successfully and hence there must be method to his madness :)</p>
