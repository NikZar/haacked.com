message: <p>Ethics are a pretty important part of consulting.  During my stint at Deloitte, I went through hours of mandatory Ethics Training just to make sure I was very clear on what to do when situations like this inevitably come up.<br>For me, I think it boils down to whether you get a good feeling about the deal.  You clearly came away from the first meeting with a bad feeling and had the good sense to contact your lawyer before proceeding further.  That was a smart move, much better than just letting your feeling convince you without validating that you were right.</p>
