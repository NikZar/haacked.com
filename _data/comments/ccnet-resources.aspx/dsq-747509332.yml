message: <p>I'm attempting to get Crusie Control.NET working with SQLUNit which uses ant as the builder.  Using the confluence Wiki I am able to see the ant output in the Crusie Control web page but not the results of the test itself.  Any recommendations on how to make this work or some sites that show how this is accomplished?<br>Hopefully this request is ok in this space. By the way I am unable to access the ccnet.thoughtworks site too<br>Thanks in advance<br>James</p>
