message: <p>Sounds like an excellent oportunity, I've love to run with one of these projects - I've always wanted to do something for the community. The ultimate question is "who is going to make the final decision on the projects, the community or Microsoft?". As Luke mention, open source projects are usually from passionate developers and developers who couldn't find a better solution.</p>
