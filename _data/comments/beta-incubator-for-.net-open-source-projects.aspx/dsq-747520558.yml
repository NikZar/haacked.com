message: <p>@Owen - it's not an "assigment" at all :). If you read my post on this I'm looking for someone who thinks this is a neat thing to move forward (our initial project, that is).<br>The CSK wasn't "assigned" to me, but I was asked by PayPal/MS if I'd like to run with it. It was an amazing opportunity and has sprung into good things. I think our hope here is that we can create these opportunities for others.</p>
