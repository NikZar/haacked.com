message: <p>I'm still fuzzy on the role of the "Incubator" - how is the incubator going to facilitate the projects ongoing and what role do they play in the day-to-day of things? Speaking a little to what Marcos is saying, is the Incubator going to perform code / design reviews in an effort to "get the buy-in"? Are we looking at a loosely typed (gosh I crack myself up) Patterns and Practices group that will orchestrate efforts? Questions and ideas, questions and ideas  . . .</p>
