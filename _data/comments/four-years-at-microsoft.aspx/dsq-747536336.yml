message: <p>Phil, I'm one of the passionate fans of Microsoft ASP.NET MVC (specifically because of Razor template engine) and I love to hear from you guys working directly on the project. The more your work at that side, the less we have to work in this side ;):). <br>Happy 4th anniversary of being a Microsoft Guy.</p>
