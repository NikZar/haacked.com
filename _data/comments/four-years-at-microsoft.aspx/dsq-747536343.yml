message: <p>You've got a great thing going, Phil. Never take that for granted while in Redmond. In my two years at Microsoft, I was on a great team, and one that was suboptimal. I miss it every day, and I'm admittedly jealous that you get to work on something with such a huge impact on developers all over the world. Keep fighting the OSS fight!</p>
