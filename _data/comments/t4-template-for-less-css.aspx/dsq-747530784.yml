message: <p>@Phil, Actually, I rescind part of my previous statement. I'm having the same problem with your sample project too. It didn't show up straight away when I opened the project, but when I right click the <a href="http://T4CSS.tt" rel="nofollow noopener" title="T4CSS.tt">T4CSS.tt</a> and choose run custom tool, it gives the same error as above. Which is jolly odd! I shall dig some more :-)</p>
