Pythons dictionary allows you to initialze them in a similar manner to Ruby.<br><a href="http://docs.python.org/tut/node7.html#SECTION007500000000000000000" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://docs.python.org/tut/node7.html#SECTION007500000000000000000">http://docs.python.org/tut/...</a><br>The ability to create dictionaries using tuples is pretty cool though. Very LISPy.<br>Pythons syntax in this case is probably the cleanest. I wonder if we'll end up mixing and mashing language features once the DLR is out. building dictionaries and dealing with data in IronRuby/IronPython but building  business logic in C#?</p>
