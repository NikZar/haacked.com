message: "<p>I'd vote for type inference as well (maybe because I like the Ruby syntax too!).<br>FWIW: for unit tests at least and when the generics are not available, I tend to use a little helper (static function for instance with params object arg) to allow calls like:<br>IDictionary order = Hash(\"price\",200.0,\"quantity\",24);<br>Not as neat but saves a lot of typing already.</p>"
