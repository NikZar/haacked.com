message: <p>I think Bob Barker is an animal crueltiest.  I hope his karma catches up with him and he is captured by a band of marauding aliens who put him on a leash, make him do humiliating tricks, castrate him and feed him dry, meat-flavored cereal.  (j/k)  Although, I guess it wouldn't sound as catchy to say:<br><br><br><br>"...until then, I'm Bob Barker and remember to have your pets undergo a vacectomy or Essure!"</p>
