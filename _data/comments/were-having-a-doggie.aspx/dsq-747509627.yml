message: <p>depending on the energy level you want from your dog, i would totally recommend a whippet (in the greyhound family, but not as "terrier" like as an IG...they call them the world's fastest couch potatoes).  i am the proud owner of a rescued whippet, and we live in perfect harmony in a ~900 SF apt.  if you've already finalized the IG papers, kudos, and welcome to the sighthound family!!!  they are (all sighthounds) simply awesome dogs.</p>
