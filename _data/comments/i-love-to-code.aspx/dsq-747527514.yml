message: <p>@Scott - Scott you are such a sad, disgruntled, negative soul that I wish you would give up coding, go do something else and stop interjecting into so many conversations when you have nothing constructive to add.  <br>Whether it is comments on blog posts, twitter conversations or any other form of media, you appear to be so totally depressed, disillusioned and negative that I hope you don't have any loaded guns in your house.  Get some help man.. and move on to a new phase of your life and leave the rest of us to get on with it.<br>Cheers.</p>
