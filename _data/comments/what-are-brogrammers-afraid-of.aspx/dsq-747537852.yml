message: <p>My girlfriend was told by her adviser during high school that she shouldn't try to take the higher level math classes, even though she was really good at math. She always tells me, who knows, she could have gone into math or CS if it wasn't for that. It's too bad, really, I think she'd make a great programmer or at least would have done well in a science career.<br></p><blockquote>There aren't any women programmers because you don't put computers in the kitchen.</blockquote><p><br>@Suq Madiq, dump your trash somewhere else, it doesn't belong here, "joking" or not.</p>
