message: <p>While I do believe that this article is completely biased to one side, I also acknowledge that sexism and discrimination are a serious problem and that they are in no way limited to just men.  It's a 50-50 split, men vs. women.  Women are just as bad as men when it comes to sexism, though they tend to be meaner (more cruel) than men, and I am speaking from experience.  For me, the best person with the best attitude gets the job.  Most people don't get the job solely due to their attitude.</p>
