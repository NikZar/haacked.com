message: <p>Ok, I have to chime in once again - can we please stop with the 'frat boy' stereotype as well? It was 'til yesterday when alpha geeks/nerds/neckbeards were the know-all bad boys of the industry and no one else was allowed, now the brogrammers are vilified... it's the everyday normal guy who moves the industry and has the word.</p>
