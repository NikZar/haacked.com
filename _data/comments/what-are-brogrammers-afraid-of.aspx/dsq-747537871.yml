message: <p>I see not conspiracy at work here and no active sex discrimination either. While my lengthy career (30 years+ and still coding) is not a representative sample, anecdotally, I can tell you I have never seen any evidence of discrimination except with respect to age. And the age discrimnation was mostly subtle with just a few overt instances.<br>I believe it is wise to steer clear of coding and I coach prospective programmers (mostly male) to go into medicine. With proper training, a medical person can have a much more satisfying career with far more autonomy and respect.<br>When I started coding a long time ago, the half-life of a coder was ten years. For good reason. Doing stupid tasks for studpid people just gets old. Dilbert was right!</p>
