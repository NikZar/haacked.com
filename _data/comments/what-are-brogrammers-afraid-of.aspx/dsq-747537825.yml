message: <p>I personally have never seen this discrimination, but am sure that there are places where it exists. My former workplace's IT department is currently almost 50% female,so bucking the trend a little. I personally don't care what gender my colleague is as long as they are competent.<br> I don't know what the solution is but the answer to promoting diversity is never positive discrimination, individuals should be employed based purely on their abilities, not on evening up the gender %s. What we need is to get more diverse applicants for these jobs in the first place and ensure a FAIR assessment process, then the capable ones will float to the top naturally.</p>
