message: <p>Thanks to Jon for the link he posted.  It was an excellent source of many, many, many, and many more approaches to dynamic WHERE and ORDER BY queries. LOL  I also have had problems with the full table scans.  Am I doing something wrong or should I just stick with index scans?  Thanks for all the help guys!<br>- Reid Moore</p>
