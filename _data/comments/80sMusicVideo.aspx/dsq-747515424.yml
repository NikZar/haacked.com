message: <p>I'm looking for this song and having trouble finding it. I know it debuted in late Summer of 1985. I used to have a cassette called Steady Nerves by Graham Parker and The Shot. I love this song and I would play it over and over again on my boom box. You Tube has the video but I don't have a pc so I can't watch it. Can someone please help me find the video to this song so I can download it for free on my I phone. Thank you very much, I appreciate any input.</p>
