message: <p>The name of the "Walking on a thin line song" is an InPursuit song by the name of "Counting on Monday" off the 1986 album "Standing in Your Shadow" I believe that's the song, and because it seems like it disappeared off the face of the Earth, I can't google the lyrics. Tell me if it's right!</p>
