message: <p>Been using Dvorak for 2 years now. It took about 6 months of to reprogramme my muscle memory. All my joint pain and finger cramping is completely gone. Another tip that came in handy, is to learn one keyboard short cut in your current ide/text editor per day and use command line tools over gui's. To stop you reaching for that damn mouse. <br>When using Qwerty I cringe, you can tell the difference. Common words and common letter combinations are so much easier and hence faster to type. <br>A good chair is a plus.<br>And a monthly remedial massage to iron out the knots in shoulder and neck is well worth the temporary pain.<br></p>
