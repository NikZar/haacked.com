message: <p>I found that these changes really help me:<br>- moved away from two monitors (17") to one larger one (24").  This really reduced the need to constantly be moving my head.<br>- taught myself to use the mouse with my left hand. This really helped when typing a lot of numbers.  Progressed from optical mouse, to trackball, to touchpad.<br>- use a split keyboard.  This keeps my arms separate and at a more comfortable angle.<br>- i placed the touchpad between the two keyboard segements so that my arm motion goes inwards (more comfortable) instead of out.</p>
