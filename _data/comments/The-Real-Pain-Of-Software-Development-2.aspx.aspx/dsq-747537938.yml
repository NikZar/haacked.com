message: <p>This is the bain of the developer. <br>I finally got an ergonomic chair last year and all my lower back pain disappeared overnight. Still get the pain in the heck/shoulders but its all about having the correct posture and taking breaks. Its does not get rid of the problems permanently but it does ease it significantly.</p>
