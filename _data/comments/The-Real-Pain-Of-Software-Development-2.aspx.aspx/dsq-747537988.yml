message: <p>Being active is such a huge part of life.  I was a gymnast my whole life until I started college and got into development.  Since then my activity level has gone from nationally ranked athlete to being in an office M-F.  Outside working out, running, swimming, anything you can do is a great help.  I am a huge supporter of take a break and stretch out, move, and most of all be active out of the office. Great post, Phil.</p>
