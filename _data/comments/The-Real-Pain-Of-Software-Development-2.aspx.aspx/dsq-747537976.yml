message: <p>I am glad I found this article when I did. I'm in the process of trying to rework my workstation at home. Desk, chair, monitor, etc. Right now it is just way too cluttered. I can't even fit a decently sized technical book on my desk. For some reason, I just feel tired and demotivated after working there for an hour or so. <br>Thanks for writing this, as it'll really help me evaluate options as I redo my workstation.</p>
