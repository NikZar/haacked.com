message: <p>I switched to a sit-to-stand workstation; it's awesome.  It raises when I need to stand(and work) &amp; lowers when I need to sit (and work).  I also switched my mouse to my left hand and found it has other mind-expanding benefits too (gets you out of your comfort zone).  That was about 10 yrs ago &amp; I've never had the pain in my left arm, my right arm healed fine.  The sit-to-stand workstation is for my lower back and let me warn you...   it's TIRING standing for so long, and this has a direct reduction on my ability to concentrate for very long at a time.</p>
