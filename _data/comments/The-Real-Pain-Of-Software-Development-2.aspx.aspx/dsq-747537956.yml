message: <p>Unfortunately, a worker compensation claim is almost unheard of in many countries, in the area of software development - in our country, in order to to fill such a claim, it should be something very serious (like electrocuting while working or something similar), and it usually involves a lawsuit (most employers will never recognize their guilt and fill first try to blame the employee) and obviously the need to find another workplace..</p>
