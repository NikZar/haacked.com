message: <p>I used to have severe pain on the wrist, knee, back and neck. What ended up helping was to exercise! Obviously I started taking more breaks but I got home and started doing exercise and everything improved significantly. Then I got two kids and working out started to become complicated, so now I ride my bike almost every day to work (30 minute trip) to keep my body active.</p>
