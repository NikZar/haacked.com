message: <p>I'm graduating highschool is that junior enough? If I get the job I'm going to need a place to stay... hint hint, Phil. I promise I'll leave my shoes at the door and always leave the toilet seat down. And when you need some alone time just leave a sock on the door. Its all good in the hood homie. Holla at your boi!</p>
