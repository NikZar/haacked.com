message: <p>Sorry about the scripting error, I thought I fixed that awhile ago... anyway, I had also planned on pursuing the parse content path... but since I want our non-technical content authors to be able to create the tags I started thinking about having them place a bulleted list of tags at the bottom of the post...<br>Going with something like the technorati plug-in would work, as long as I parse and then remove whatever they add to their posts.</p>
