message: "<p>Two small comments :<br>1. I wouldn't say \"an enumeration of HttpPostedFileBase\" but \"an IEnumerable of HttpPostedFileBase\" to avoid confusion with the enum type<br>2. If the two files come from different client folders AND have the same file name the last file will win on the server (i.e.: it will overwrite the first)</p>"
