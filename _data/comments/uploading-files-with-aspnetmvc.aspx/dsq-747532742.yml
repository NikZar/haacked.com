message: "<p>Seems easy enough, but I'm getting an error on the 'Path' - \"Path does not exist in current context\". <br>I've a context file, but this is for a different page.  Help?<br>By the way, @Themhs: you'll need to add some code in your web config page: &lt;httpRuntime maxRequestLength=\"x\" /&gt;  \"x\" being the number of KB's.  I think the default is 4MB.</p>"
