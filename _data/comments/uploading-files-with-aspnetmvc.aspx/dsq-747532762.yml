message: <p>In order to restrict the type of files users couple upload (e.g. I only want them to upload word documents in this case), I used the following code.  I think it could be tweaked for folks wanting image directories, etc.<br>if (file.ContentLength &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; (Path.GetExtension(file.FileName) == (".doc") || Path.GetExtension(file.FileName) == ".docx"))<br>This way I can put it whereever I want.</p>
