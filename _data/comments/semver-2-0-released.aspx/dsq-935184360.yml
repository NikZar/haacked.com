message: <p>Right. Build metadata was called build number before, and compared lexicographically. but now, if it's .3 (say) then the numerical portion is compared as a number, not a string.<br>in some cases, this changes the order of some semver versions, and so therefore this IS a breaking change.</p><p>Great. I was just confused because the text wasn't explicit enough.</p><p>Carry on!</p>
