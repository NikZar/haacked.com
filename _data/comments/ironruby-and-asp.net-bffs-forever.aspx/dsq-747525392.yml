message: <p>@Tim, I actually addressed that in my post<br></p><blockquote><br>And for those that don’t know, BFF is an acronym for Best Friends Forever. Yes, the “Forever” is redundant in the blog title, but it’s just how people use it.<br></blockquote><p><br>Google it, and you'll see what I mean. "Ooh yeah, we're BFFs forever!"</p>
