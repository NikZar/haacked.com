message: <p>I have been reading a ton on the Web Client Factory, and also on ASP.NET MVC, could you maybe do a write up comparing these two factories/frameworks which would be great for developers to see Microsoft's opinions on the frameworks that they make available to the development community.<br>thanks!</p>
