message: <p>My first Churrascaria place was in Rio called Porcao.   Instead of a red/green dial, each table was given a poker chip that (fittingly) had a picture of a pig on each side.  On one side, the pig was holding two forks up, and on the other, the pig was holding the forks down.<br><br><br><br>For the rest of our travels in South America, my wife and I would say "pigs up" or "pigs down" to indicate if we had eaten enough.</p>
