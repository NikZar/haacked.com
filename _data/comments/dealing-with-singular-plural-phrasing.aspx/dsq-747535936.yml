message: <p>@Sam, <br>Obviously UX decisions are rather subjective and depend heavily on the type of the project. Having pluralization may or may not add any benefit at all. <br>What I'm arguing is the value obtained relative to (overall) effort, and in my opinion this effort can be used elsewhere with more added value.<br>Having worked on some heavily localized projects, I can say that ignoring this issue can bring more benefit (even more polish in other areas) than trying to solve it.<br><br><br></p>
