message: <p>We actually store the whole sentence in the resx files.E.g. A sentence for zero, 1 and more results. If you mingle individual words like in your example it gets difficult to translate afterwards. And yes, don't forget the 0 case as Karel pointed out. Maybe we need something where you can add as many different plural phrasing as you want, so it works for all languages.</p>
