message: <p>I think you are right on here, this is quality.  Anyone who says this is a waste of time and effort has no freaking clue what polish is or what quality is for that matter.  We have reached an evolution in software design that begs for a high degree of polish, its no longer acceptable for our software to "do" what its suppose to do to get the job done.  Consumers, and users alike assume it will "do", and want polish/shine.  Their needs and wants have shifted, for the better IMO!</p>
