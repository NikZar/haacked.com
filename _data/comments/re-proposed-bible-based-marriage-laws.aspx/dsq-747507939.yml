message: <p>Thanks for bringing up this issue.  Almost all Christian books concerning dating and sexuality do not have a strong biblical basis and are rather one person's view of morality.  I have looked high and low for books that discuss the historical and cultural context behind scripture verses and Old Testament stories on sexuality and sexual relationships, but to no avail.  The ONLY book I have found so far that does this is a book called The Struggle.  It talks about what the Bible does (or rather doesn't) say about masturbation and looks at the cultural and historical context behind popular "masturbation" verses.  It then discusses how this new information can be lived out.  I have also talked with pastors who can't give a definitive answer and I am taking a class on this subject at a seminary because the answer to my question has proved so elusive.  It saddens and angers me that the church pushes a certain view of morality without really being able to explain the context within which the scripture verses they use to defend their views are based.  This can be so hurtful to people who struggle to fit a "church mold" that isn't well understood by the very people who are pushing it.  I know because I work in youth ministry, I've heard the sermons, read the youth curriculum, and discussed the topic with many in the church.  People only understand how to take these verses and directly apply them to life, rather than understanding their author's real intention by exploring the cultural and historical context in which they were written, and then applying them to life.<br><br><br><br>If anyone can shed light on this question of context or knows of books that address it, I would greatly appreciate the information.  Thanks!</p>
