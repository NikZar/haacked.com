message: <p>Ok, my concern is it almost seems like I'm writing more code in tests and stubs and such, than actual logic.  The more code I write the more bugs I introduce.<br>So who will tests the tests?<br>This is the problem I have with writing layers of abstraction and such just to make my code easier.  By introducing all that other stuff, I risk crapifying my codebase.<br></p>
