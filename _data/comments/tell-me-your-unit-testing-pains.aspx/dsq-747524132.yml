message: <p>TDD best practice examples. I learn nothing from books, articles etc unless I can fire up a relevant example. Thanks to Phil H here for some seminal articles.<br>Webcasts seem to have the highest ratio of time spent to knowledge gained (I particularly recommend the awesome 1 hour long <a href="http://www.ayende.com/97/section.aspx/download/194" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.ayende.com/97/section.aspx/download/194">webcast on RhinoMocks using TDD in VS2005 featuring Resharper</a> from Ayende - it was worth a month of reading books to see an expert at work)</p>
