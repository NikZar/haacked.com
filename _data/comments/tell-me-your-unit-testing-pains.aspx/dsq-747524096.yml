message: <p>Not entirely on topic, but the MailAddress object validates the email address in its constructor and fails with an exception when the address is not properly formatted. That caused a bug in my application, and I want to write a unit test to verify that. The test is easy to write, but the fix is not. I would like to use the very same validation code as the constructor, but I can't. It's internal.</p>
