message: <p>Phil,<br>It's great that you're asking the community for this kind of input and experience report.  Kudos to you for the initiative.<br>However, if this input is needed to help guide the testability aspects of the MVC framework for ASP .NET, then it's a cause for dismay in the case that you wouldn't already be in possession of the relevant, tangible, hard-won experience in testability design and TDD.<br>I hope you can excuse my cynicism on this and the obvious and inevitable slight to you, but my experience with Microsoft over the past few years in regards to lip service paid to these issues informs my caution quite strongly.</p>
