message: <p>&gt;&gt;then you put them in the hands of the grunts in the trenches like me<br>Those techniques came from people who were "grunts in the trenches" and are used by many people who are "grunts in the trenches" with much praise.  You should rephrase your statement to be something like "then you put them in the hands of someone who doesn't want to learn and already has a predisposition against it and who thinks pretty damned highly of their abilities as is and they fall apart mainly because of the lack of effort, understanding and perhaps intelligence of the person behind the keyboard"</p>
