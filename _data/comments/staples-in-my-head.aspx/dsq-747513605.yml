message: <p>I just had surgery on my head for a skull implant placement becuase I fell from a 30 feet high balcony and broke my skull in over 20 pieces and had those removed in January. Now I have 58 staples on my head. 1 which hurt when they stapled me when i WAS AWAKE. it's kind of scary seeing some of the staples now.<br>any needles hurt like the ones for IVs or blood taking for blood testing.</p>
