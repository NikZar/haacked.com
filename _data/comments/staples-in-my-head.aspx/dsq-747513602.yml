message: <p>i was about to have my tea when i heard the lady from the flat below being attacked i went to help only to meet 4 balaclava wearing chaps who hit me over the head with a baseball bat which resulted in me receiving nine staples and the hospital gave me a funny thing that were like scissors so i could remove them myself nice</p>
