message: <p>I think you made a smart choice not climbing to the top.  My brother should be included in the small memorial because he died climbing down Haystack last August.  He was a strong 27 year old who was an experienced hiker.  He and his friend made it to the top, and we have pictures and a video from his camera memory card.  We aren't exactly sure how he fell, but it seems that he lost his footing and fell 200 ft.  I know people like to take risks because of the thrill and sense of accomplishment, but use caution and follow your instincts!</p>
