message: <p>Lets first see who shows up for the Real Madrid.  They always say that they are bringing the big dogs so as to promote a sellout and then they show up with only the backups.  As if things were not bad enough for the Galaxy, they may be without Landon.  I saw the Galaxy last night without him because of a team USA comittment and they looked aweful.  It will be stupid for them to play the R.M. without their top squad.  What a waste.</p>
