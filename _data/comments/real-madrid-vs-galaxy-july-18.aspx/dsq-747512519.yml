message: <p>Sure... Galaxy is not RM.  MLS is not La Liga.  So what? in case those of you who are putting down American soccer don't remember is that the USA put up a better show than many soccer super-power countries in the last worldcup.  Luck? may be.. still was a better place. Besides, what other country has a newer pro-league than MLS is?  You better watch out, you better not cry!  American soccer is growing step by step..  Jest remember.. no one gives a break to the USA.. whatever we do, we do it well!  Our athletes are courageous and never give up.  They might not always win, but they give a good fight to anybody.  If it hurts.. use some vaseline.<br><br><br><br>Jan</p>
