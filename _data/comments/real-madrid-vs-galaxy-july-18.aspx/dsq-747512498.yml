message: <p>I thought Argentina beat the Brazilians 3-0.  The USA is already considered among the best 15 teams in the World.  <br><br>I coach youngsters in the East coast and I can tell you they play as well as europeans and south americans at their age.<br><br><br><br>Have faith!  The USA is coming!!  give us two more World Cups and we will be there at the top!</p>
