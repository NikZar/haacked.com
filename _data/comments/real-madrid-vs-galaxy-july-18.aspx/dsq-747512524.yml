message: <p>Just came back from the RM game and, of course, they won.  Im not going to rant and rave about the team, I was, however, VERY IMPRESSED with Zindane.  Zindane is the best player I have ever seen play live.  AMAZING CONTROL OF THE BALL.  <br><br><br><br>Also, was anyone surprised how Figo was so well received.  I think he had the best reception out of any other player.  He was the only one that had a name chant!</p>
