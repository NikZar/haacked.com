message: <p>The fact is Donovan proved himself in the 2002 World Cup. He was able to compete and score world class goals against the best the world had to offer. You can talk him down all you want for playing in the mls instead of on an foriegn club team. but i for one am glad to go down to the Home Depot center and watch him win games.... AND KC KELLER IS GOD!!!!!!!!...</p>
