message: <p>I will be at the 7/18 game and I expect to see the stars from Spain show up and make a match of it. Zidane, Beckham, Owens, Figo, Carlos and Raul I ahve watched over the years and each has special skills worth viewing in person. Anything less than the complete package will be a great disappointment, to sya the least.</p>
