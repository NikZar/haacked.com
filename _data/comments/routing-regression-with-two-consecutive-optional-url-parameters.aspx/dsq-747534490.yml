message: "<p>Hi Phil, <br>  What's your opinion about this issue: <a href=\"http://forums.asp.net/t/1328683.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://forums.asp.net/t/1328683.aspx\">http://forums.asp.net/t/1328683.aspx</a> ? The solution proposed by tgmdbm didnt work and I had to \"hardcode\" the routing. Meaning that, instead of using \"Url.Action(blabla)\", I have to do \"Url.RouteUrl(blabla)\".<br>Thanks<br>Damian</p>"
