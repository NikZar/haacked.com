message: <p>Hi Phil, You've been hacked!<br>Well, technicaly you've just inserted an empty H2-element before the "The Workaround"-heading, so IE9 makes the rest of the page look really akward. <br>Other browser render the "closed" H2 (&lt;h2 /&gt;) as an empty header, that is 0 (zero) pixel tall.</p>
