message: <p>Thnax for the workaround tip haacked! Although of course it would be great if the bug itself could be fixed (with an update for instance), cause (imho) when the workarounds start to sum up, at some point you will lose the overview of wht's what and what/how exactly you worked around a bug (if it hast to be adjusted at some point for example).</p>
