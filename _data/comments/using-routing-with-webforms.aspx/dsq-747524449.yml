message: <p>I fixed that problem by deriving a handler from UrlRoutingHandler and referencing it.<br>However, I have another issue now. If the routing does not end with an .aspx extension, I get "Request for principal permission failed." when trying to use PrincipalPermission Demand() authentication using a custom principal.</p>
