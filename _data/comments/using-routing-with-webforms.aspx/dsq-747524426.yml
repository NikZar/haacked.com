message: <p>Hi Phil, great blog!  I have implemented a routing handler for web forms using the approach you outline here.  One problem I am having is that HttpContext.Current.Session is null in the page I construct and route to in the WebFormRouteHandler.  Session is not null on ordinary, non routed, pages in my application.  I am using .NET 3.5 sp1, I have not used any of the MVC previews.  Any insight is appreciated.  Thank you!</p>
