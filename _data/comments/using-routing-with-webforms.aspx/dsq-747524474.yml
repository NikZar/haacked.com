message: <p>Phil,<br>Thanks for the technique - it really helps us. However we've noticed that on occasion the first call to CreateInstanceFromVirtualPath can take a long while (tens of seconds) to return. During that time we can see a C# compiler process (csc.exe) chewing up 10%-50% of our CPU cycles.<br>Any thoughts on potential fixes for this issue?</p>
