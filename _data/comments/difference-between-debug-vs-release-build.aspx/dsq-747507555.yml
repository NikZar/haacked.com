message: <p>It's observed that some of the MSVC++ calls work find in the debug mode, but fail functionally in the release builds. <br>These are specifically referring to the FreeExtra call used in our application. <br>The debug mode shows a clear reducion in the private memory bytes, while release mode, does not show any changes. <br>Any help / pointers will be appreciatd ...<br> <br>Regards,<br>Shirish</p>
