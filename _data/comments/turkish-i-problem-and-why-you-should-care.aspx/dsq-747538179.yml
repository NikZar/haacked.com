message: <p>Too bad .NET does not have a standard method on strings for Unicode case folding. Adhering to the Unicode standard by using case FOLDING to compare strings in a case-insensetive way instead of introducing both an ordinal and invariant way of doing a case-insensitive will not wipe away all the differences between cultures, but it does implement a well-known and well-defined way of comparing strings without any regards to case. Notice that String.Normalize(NormalizationForm) IS part of the framework since .NET 2.0! Maybe it's time for a few extension methods on strings to fill in the gap ...</p>
