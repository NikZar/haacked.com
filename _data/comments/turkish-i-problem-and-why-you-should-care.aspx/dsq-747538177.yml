message: "<p>There's a famous story about Ramazan Çalçoban, who wrote to his friend (and probablty a girlfriend) Emin an SMS, that ws received with \"sikisince\" (\"they are fucking you\") instead of \"sıkısınca\" (\"run out of arguments\"). The result was: one murder, one suicide, three people are put in jail.</p>"
