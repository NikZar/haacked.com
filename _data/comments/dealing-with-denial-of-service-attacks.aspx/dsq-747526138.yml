message: <p>I wonder if you or anyone else can offer up anything more substantial?<br>Are there are any automated tools or utilities out there to help identify an attack?  Anything which could automatically block the attackers?<br>Last year when I discovered my SQL Server database was the subject of a brute force attack, I was able to block the attacks via manually creating an IP/Sec policy.<br>I wonder if IP/Sec could be used similarly to block a DDoS or DoS attack?  I'm no expert when it comes to IP/Sec, and found it pretty tedious/confusing to setup last year.</p>
