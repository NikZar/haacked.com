message: <p>hi,<br>that sounds great, but in my opinion in large mvc-appliactions there is no way of using neither viewdatadictionary nor viewdata as dynamic object - the only way are strongly typed viewdata objects for each view, so you can easily recocnize which data is available in views.<br></p>
