message: <p>Don't listen to the abuse fearers! This is a great use of dynamic. You are replacing a late-bound, ugly syntax with a late-bound, beautiful syntax. What can possibly be wrong with that?<br>The same pitfalls that existed before still exist, but it's easier on the eyes. The only problem I'd see is that it makes it *seem* safer but who cares really? I don't.<br>That makes me miss JavaScript on the server a little less. I'd definitely use that.</p>
