message: <p>ah HA! I figured it out for version 5.0<br>In the preferences menu search for "configure"<br>you'll see "Chat Windows" is the only thing not grayed out.<br>Go to "Chat Windows" and scroll to the bottom where it has the "Configure Instant Lookup..." button and click it<br>You'll then need to delete 'configure' from the search window so you can see all the boxes to uncheck.</p>
