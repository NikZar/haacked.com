message: <p>Hi Jim,<br><br><br><br>That's actually quite challenging.  You could attempt to use .NET's balanced matching mechanism, but it's pretty difficult to get the grasp of and it's not standard Regex.<br><br><br><br>It really depends what you're trying to accomplish.  One way I've done it is to use a regex that matches html tags and then strip all tags out.<br><br><br><br>Hope that helps.</p>
