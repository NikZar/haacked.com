message: <p>Hi Folks,<br>I'm trying to get plain text out of "any" html document, which seems to be quite difficult to do cause most of the regex I tried doesn't match scripts, styles and so on. Any suggestions to do it in a different way, I'm programming in C# .NET<br>Thanks in advance and sorry for my poor english<br></p>
