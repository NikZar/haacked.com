message: <p>That's always been a struggle for me as well...how much personal content to post on what I consider to be a "tech" blog. At this point I just write about whatever the hell I feel like writing about (it's all about categories baby). I'm not as smart as Atwood and can't come up w/ a cool technical post every day :-).</p>
