message: <p>Hi Phil,<br>I was using JSON.NET for DTO serialization (JSON format) and was happy with it. Haven't look on the sample (will have time on weekend) but is there a possibility to exchange default serialization engine with JSON.NET somewhere?<br>Is there a source code avaiable?<br>Thanks for the answer!</p>
