message: <p>@Kiran:<br>this is a known behavior of Chrome and one that others also find incorrect. there's currently a bug filed for the issue, you can see it here:<br><a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=13137" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=13137">code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=13137</a><br>if this is blocking you I can probably get passed it by special casing the content-nego code for User-Agent "Chrome/*".</p>
