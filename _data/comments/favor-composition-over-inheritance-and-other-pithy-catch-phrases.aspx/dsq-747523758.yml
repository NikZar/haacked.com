message: <p>@Ryan - I agree. I think what I didn't make clear is that it's been thrown at me as "Composition over Inheritance". I'll talk about a case where I believe inheritance is valid and get the response "Composition over Inheritance". Over and over again like a broken record.<br>Gread advice. Certainly. Better advice when you understand <em>why</em> it's great advice.</p>
