message: "<p>I'm totally digging the idea of <br><strong>1.0.1-alpha.###</strong><br>The dash separation is perfectly legal, improves readability a bit, and makes  a pretty nice separator between the version and the pre-release parts. It may even help in determining you have a prerelease because you can just scan the version for \"-\".<br>Showing an ordering: <br>1.0.0-alpha.001<br>1.0.0-apha<br>1.0.0-alpha1.001<br>1.0.0-alpha1.002<br>1.0.0-apha1<br>1.0.0-beta<br>1.0.0-rc<br>1.0.0<br><br>Thoughts?</p>"
