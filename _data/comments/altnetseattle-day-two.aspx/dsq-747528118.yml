message: <p>Just wanted to say thanks for that session.  I really dug the conversation and it was kewl to converse with others who would like to see the same things happen.  Namely the inclusion of other testing tools or even ms-test being open sourced to some degree for greater acceptance of the other tools.<br>Karen, Euan, &amp; u Phil.  Thx for the session - it was good stuff.</p>
