message: <p>Well that didn't save you a line of code.  You hade to write TestFunctionHelper. Also, what if you needed the SetUp and TearDown function to run between each call to TestMyFunctionHelper?<br>Now imagine your next test that takes in three parameters or four? You'll have to write more test function helpers.  You could certainly write one that takes in a delegate, but why when MbUnit offers all that to you for free?<br>Also, you should install TestDriven.NET and test right from your IDE. I almost never use the MbUnit GUI.</p>
