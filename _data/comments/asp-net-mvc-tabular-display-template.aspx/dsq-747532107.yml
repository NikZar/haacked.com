message: <p>In your example you're hiding the loop inside the template, but what if I do it the other way around and call DisplayForModel inside a loop which requires IDs on form elements? Will the IDs generated by such helpers as EditorFor be unique, or would I need to manage that myself somehow? And if that's the case, what would be the recommended method of dealing with this?</p>
