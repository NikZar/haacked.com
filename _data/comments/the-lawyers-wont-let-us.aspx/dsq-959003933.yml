message: <p>This make me think of the IS department in our company. They are dictating IS policy to the business - however, they are so risk averse and feel the need to cover their backsides with so much red tape, that it is nearly impossible for change to happen (making our job as developers a lot harder than it needs to be). It really would be so much better if the company could say, "here's what we want to do...", and IS set about achieving it in the shortest time with minimal risk! (btw... the development team I'm on isn't part of IS :-)   )</p>
