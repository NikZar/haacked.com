message: <p>Phil, I think that yes, arrogance is required for the biggest success, and you can see it in both Steve Jobs and in Pelé.  When the success comes though, the arrogance is often called self belief or confidence.<br>Look at some of Pelé's greatest moments; to even attempt moves with such audacity requires so much faith in oneself that what else is it but arrogance?</p>
