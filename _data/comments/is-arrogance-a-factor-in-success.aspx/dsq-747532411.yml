message: <p>We call someone "arrogant" when they think they are right and we think they are wrong. I don't think we can call Jobs(or Gates) as arrogant. They knew what was right and proved the critiques wrong time and again.<br>Just because someone doesn't agreed to preset rules, doesn't make them arrogant.</p>
