message: <p>A great leader can bring great results, but the essence of a contagious behaviour must have deep roots, if someone don´t like what he does or what he has to spread, it will be just a fake, something sustained by comercial strategies and sponsors interests but far from the pleasure that you can feel doing something that you have a passion, and use it because is natural not enforced.</p>
