message: <p>I'm from Argentina and in respect to our rivalry I believe there's much mutual respect than anything else :)<br>Now back to the topic in question, I think you need to define your view on <strong>success</strong><br>Is success about how much money you have? respect? selling a piece of hardware? how many true friends/human relationships one has?<br>Quite the opposite, I believe in order to be "truly" successful one must try NOT to be arrogant.</p>
