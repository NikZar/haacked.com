message: <p>Routing matches routes in order. <code>{controller}/{action}</code> will match any 2 segment route. Well, <code>/home.mvc/index</code> is a 2 segment URL, so it is going to match.<br>The fix should be as simple as re-ordering the two routes and putting the <code>{controller}.mvc/{action}</code> route first.</p>
