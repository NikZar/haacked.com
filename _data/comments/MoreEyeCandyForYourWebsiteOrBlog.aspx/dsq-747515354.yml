message: <p>I meant the back button is not disabled, unlike a modal dialog in which nothing works.  But yes, it doesn't work as expected (ie it doesn't take the user back one step).<br>I have seen Ajax implementations that do work with the back button (Magic Ajax comes to mind) so there might be a way to fix it.</p>
