message: <p>It's not a Modal Dialog Mr. Curmudgeon.  The Refresh and Back button still works.<br>Think of it this way. It's just a fancier way to transition to another page while retaining the context of the old page as a background.  For example, that little box could be an advanced search box.<br>Not sure if this really makes it more or less usable (would need to put it in front of people and observer to determine that).<br></p>
