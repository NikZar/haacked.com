message: <p>@Haacked<br>Great news! I've found the problem - though I still don't know how to fix it.<br>I 'extend' most of my Linq to SQL models by using partial classes. I simply removed all of the extensions and the runtime worked. I've never had to implement anything special in the partial class files based on my LINQ to SQL models - so I think something is still different. Any ideas?<br>I tried to mimic the structure of the original Linq to SQL markup (implementing INotifyPropertyChanging, INotifyPropertyChanged) but I still got the errors. Is there some specific interface I need to add into my partial class to make this work properly?</p>
