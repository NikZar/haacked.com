message: <p>Just to let you guys know, there's a pretty major goof in this installer. <br>The ASP.NET.MVC 1.1 'library', for some reason, is showing the Model helper as 'object' instead of IEnumerable. For this reason, it's not possible to iterate using the page scaffolding method - you have to REALLY leap through hoops.</p>
