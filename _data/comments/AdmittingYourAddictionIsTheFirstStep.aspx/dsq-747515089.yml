message: <p>How do you guys find enough time to play even 2 hours of a video game? I can barely find enough time to finish a Sudoku puzzle and I'm only getting 5 hours of sleep a night. I've got games sitting next to my Xbox:Classic that I haven't finished (Fable for one). The entire Xbox is getting traded in for a Nintendo DS Lite in June. It's easier to play during the bus ride to work or during lunch.<br></p>
