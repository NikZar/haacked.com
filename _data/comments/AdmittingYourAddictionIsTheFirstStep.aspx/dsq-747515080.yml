message: "<p>I have finally beaten my addiction.  It took 86 hours in about a three week span but every second was worth it.  I wasn't satisfied to just beat the main story either.  I am head of every guild, grand champion of the area... you name it, I had to do it.<br>Every victory was like another hit off the pipe.  Warcraft?  SW: Galaxies?  These are just gateway drugs.  Oblivion is the life-ruining white powder they warn you about in school.</p>"
