message: <p>Unfortunately, it is you that misses the point. One of the Senators (Rep. Kennedy) actually said he already had a nephew on the way to Afghanistan. Moore chose not to include that footage, as it would have made the whole scene look pointless. I guess if you only include the footage that promotes your view and exclude the footage that make your view pointless, then you can always get the yahoos to buy your lies.</p>
