message: <p>Something that is often missed in discussions about congress people sending their children to fight in the war (any war) is that you can't SEND your kid. They have to sign  up for themselves as an adult. So suggesting that someone "sign up" their child is an obvious ploy in my opinion.<br><br><br><br></p>
