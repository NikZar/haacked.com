message: <p>By the way, in 1941-1945, Russian parents were crying but sending their children to the WWII (better known in Russia as a Great Patriotic War). Why? Because they knew it's a life or death question for all of them and the country. Russia lost 30 million people in that war, but it survived itself and made the whole world survive.<br><br><br><br>I think the question is perfectly fine - if it's not life or death question, it probably can be negotiated and settled, and there's no need to send your kids in.<br><br><br><br></p>
