message: <p>Thanks for the tip.  This worked well.  The only problem I ran into was I use <code>HttpMethodConstraint</code>.  To make this work with unit testings, I had to mock the <code>Request.HttpMethod</code> with this Moq line<br><code>httpContextMock.Setup(c =&gt; c.Request.HttpMethod).Returns("POST");</code></p>
