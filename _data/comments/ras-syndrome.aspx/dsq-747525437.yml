message: <p>So true. We do add emphasis or direction when including words after an acronym. Another thing people do is try and qualify an word that should not be qualified. It makes my skin crawl when I hear Absolutly unique. Ugg. Just typing it... Its like saying Absolutly pregnant. Either you are or are not. No shades of grey are allowed.</p>
