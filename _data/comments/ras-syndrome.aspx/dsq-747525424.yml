message: <p>@Scott - recursive acronyms are an ancient (by computer standards) art, dating back at least to 1978. GNU (GNU's Not Unix) is the most famous from that time, but there were others that pre-date it. Take a look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_acronym" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_acronym">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_acronym</a> for an idea of how many there are out there.</p>
