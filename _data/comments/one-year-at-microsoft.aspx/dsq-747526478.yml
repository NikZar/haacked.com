message: <p>Congratulations, Phil :-) <br>To be honest, you didn't keep your valuable activity on open source community and also didn't write much on your blog but it's quite understandable for everyone. <br>As a note about those college people, IMHO you (as a someone with industrial) background can be as valuable as them or even more because the academic context is not very pragmatic and I found that few academic people can do well on industrial projects at infancy but as time goes, they can do more, so it's obvious that your experiences in industry is invaluable to the company. <br>All in all, time went fast. I think it was yesterday when you left Koders ;-)</p>
