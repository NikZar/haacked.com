message: <p>My son is 18 now. I only need to see a photo or video of him when he was six to realize how STUNNINGLY gone that person is, and how much I've already lost of him. How grateful I am to have the moments of 'now' and 'today' to share with him. To say "there is plenty of time" is to say something we can't possibly know for a fact. One fact we all agree on... we will all die. Sitting in my cube staring at an LCD screen only proves that I'm in some denial about that fact, too. Anyway, the moments just before death will be pure anguish for those of us who squandered our potential, our life, for the cause of 'just a little more comfort'. To work at sparing each other that ultimate anguish is to truly be compassionate.</p>
