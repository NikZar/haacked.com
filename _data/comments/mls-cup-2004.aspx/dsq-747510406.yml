message: "<p>Great game yesterday afternoon... no shortage of excitement or drama. As a Rapids fan, I was glad to see DC get the win and not Kansas City. More specifically, I was glad to not see Josh Wolff anywhere near the Cup. :)<br><br><br><br>I'm betting KC fans are taking out a hit on Eskandarian's right arm today (re: his breakaway goal).<br><br><br><br></p>"
