message: <p>"Google" is a trademark. You have to enforce trademarks, not patents. Once you are granted a patent, it's up to you whether or not you want to sue people for infringing upon it. But it can't be revoked. (IANAL)<br>Whether or not they intend to sue or actually do sue anybody, they've started losing even more mindshare among developers with this kind of action. Mike Gunderloy is just the tip of the iceberg. What if MS has a patent for "an application that stores content in a database and provides an RSS feed"? Subtext? What happens if they look at SubSonic and decide it's a little too much like LINQ or their entities framework? <br>Attacking Open Source isn't just about linux developers. It's extrememly short sighted and extremely Balmer.</p>
