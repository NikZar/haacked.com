message: <p>Couldn't agree more about the disconnect within MS.  This whole lawsuit thing seems to be coming from the "old school MS" camp led by Balmer.<br>The "new school MS" camp which represented themselves largely at Mix07 doesn't stand for this kind of garbage.<br>Honestly I think the MS shareholders should call for Balmer to step down after this.  When he leaves then maybe he can take the rest of the old school camp with him.</p>
