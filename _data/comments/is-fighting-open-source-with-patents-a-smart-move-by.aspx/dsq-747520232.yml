message: <p>When a company does not do enough to enforce their patents, they put themselves in danger of losing those patents.  It was a bad day for Google's lawyers when the verb "google" was added to the dictionary.  This sort of thing makes patents difficult to defend.  When something is too common patents lose their value.<br>That is probably the real reason Microsoft is doing this.</p>
