message: <p>It's certainly true that Microsoft should be allowed to defend their intellectual property. However, I agree 100% that a FUD campaign is the last thing that they need. I also agree that if they made any real effort at stifling the open-source movement, developers would leave the .NET stack in droves just on principle. I guess it comes down to the strategy of the company. What's more important --  selling Vista and Office, or having the next "killer app" written for your platform by an ISV or lone developer? Since the former is more quantifiable as to the bottom line than the latter, I'm not surprised to see the execs lean that way. Short-sighted, though, if you ask me.</p>
