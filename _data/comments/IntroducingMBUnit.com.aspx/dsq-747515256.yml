message: <p>Very cool.  The benefit with having both is discoverability.  Often, when someone tells me about a technology, I'll go to the browser and try <a href="http://technologyname.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="technologyname.com">technologyname.com</a> even befor googling it.  Now if you do that with mbunit, it'll work. :)</p>
