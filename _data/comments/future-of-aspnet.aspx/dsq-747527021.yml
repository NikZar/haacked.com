message: <p>It's nice being able to control the ClientIDs.  I've tried it on the PDC preview VPC image and it seems to handle a number of scenarios.  How about letting us control the <u>name</u> attribute also?  Am I the only one that would want that?  I guess I want it for the same reason I want to be able to control my client side <u>id</u> attributes... ULTIMATE and COMPLETE CONTROL!  :)<br></p>
