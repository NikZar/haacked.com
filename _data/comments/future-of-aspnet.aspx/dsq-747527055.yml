message: "<p>Neal Blomfield said: <br>\"How backwards do you have to be to keep loving WebForms!?!\"<br>This short sited view is becoming boring.<br>If you understand how to wield webworms correctly they are a very powerful and scalable platform .<br>I’m not talking for rad development either, I’m talking about enterprise level n-tier architectures, implementing MVP in the UI layer no less.<br>I know webforms attracts allot of hacky code due to it being too open end for its own good (and Microsofts insistence on pushing the drag and drop elements of it) but many of us know the good from the bad and choose webforms with a solid understanding of it's pros, cons and possibilities.<br><br></p>"
