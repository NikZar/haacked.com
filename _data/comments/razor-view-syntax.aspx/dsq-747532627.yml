message: <p>This looks great and I can't wait to get the bits to play around with in my MVC apps.  <br>I'm also thinking that a byproduct of your work making this testable also makes it an easy to use html templating engine in general.  One scenario that would definately make my job a little easier would to use razor as a templating engine for generating email notifications. <br>How trivial would it be to use razor in that manner?</p>
