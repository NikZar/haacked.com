message: <p>Another good tip to remember:<br>All hard drives eventually fail.<br>Many people look at disk failures like winning the lottery - it might happen but it's so rare you should plan around it.  The reality is, it *will* happen, you just don't know if it will happen today.<br>Hope you get everything fully recovered!</p>
