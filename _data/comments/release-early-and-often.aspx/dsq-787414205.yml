message: <p>Just saw this, and immediately recommended it to someone I was writing to about RERO. I'm a psychotherapist, and he's a writer/marketing consultant. We see serious benefits to "force-fitting" this model to our work, and are already doing it. This is a good and useful essay you wrote, and I appreciate both your research and your experience. Good stuff!</p>
