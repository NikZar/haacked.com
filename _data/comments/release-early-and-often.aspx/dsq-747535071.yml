message: <p>A further problem with Release Early/Often is that such releases are usually accompanied by minimal or no documentation. Meanwhile all over the web people write tutorials and code snippets based on preview builds which have incorrect code. This material is rarely deleted or updated, and it can be years before it no longer appears in search results.</p>
