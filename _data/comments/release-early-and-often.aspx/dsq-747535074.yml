message: <p>I personally find that the release early and often to be really frustrating.  For example, i start creating a new MVC 3 website today which will take several months to complete....By the time the website is live we're already seeing a the next version of MVC (4) being released.  What should i tell my clients? Should i recommend the client pay $$ to upgrade? etc<br><br>I think people in the enthusiast / hobby camp prefer early and frequent releases.  But for people who create and/or maintain production code will find it very frustrating.</p>
