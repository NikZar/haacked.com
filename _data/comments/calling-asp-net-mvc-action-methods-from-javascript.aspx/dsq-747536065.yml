message: <p>I'm a little late getting to this, but it looks great.  However, is there a similar feature in MVC 4 I should be looking at in lieu of this?  Phil mentioned in the article that this is a proof of concept as much as anything.  Thanks again for writing about this subject, it's meeting a definite need.</p>
