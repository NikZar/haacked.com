message: <p>This upgrade has definatly not been all it was cracked up to be.  The site has been up all of 30 minutes in the last 4 days.  <br>I'd say the move was a complete blunder...I'm no Chief Technology Executive but there are these things called testing servers...you can even do load tests on them to simulate real world use but Washington Mutual decided not to go that route and instead has stood by and watched as the entire site came to a screaching hault on Sunday.  Booooo Washington Mutual I.S. department....hoooray Beer!<br>I give em 1 more day and then I'm switching banks.<br>Tobin<br></p>
