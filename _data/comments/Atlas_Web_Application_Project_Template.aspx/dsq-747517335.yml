message: <p>Phil, this looks great, hope it turns out to be what I hope it is...<br>I'm also looking for a Microsoft Project template for planning a WEB APPLICATION project. As opposed to a Software project or a normal web site. Seems so few people 'get' the difference between a web site and a web application :-)</p>
