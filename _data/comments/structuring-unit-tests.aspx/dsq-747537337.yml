message: <p>Question about Nuget website (<a href="http://nuget.org" rel="nofollow noopener" title="nuget.org">nuget.org</a>) related, is there is some documentation (or blog post), which can explain about the website design, as it is so generously been open sourced and so soundly structured. (A really real world Asp.Net MVC uses example).<br>Thanks</p>
