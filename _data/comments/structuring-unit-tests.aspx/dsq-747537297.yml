message: <p>Interesting. I've been looking for something different and this might be it. I've tried various namespace approaches and naming strategies (at one point putting the test cases in folders underneath the main classes). Nothing has really clicked. I never thought of nested classes so it seems pretty elegant. Going to try this on a new project and see if I get more traction than before. Thanks guys!</p>
