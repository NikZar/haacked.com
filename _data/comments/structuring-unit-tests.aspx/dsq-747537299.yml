message: <p>If only you would remove duplication with it.<br>At least for the example of UsersService I find that there is <br>1. Too much code duplication for the setup of the CryptoService<br>2. The method Create for example, has a lot of responsibilities beyond its intended purpose (validation, hashing, token creation)<br>Other than that, it will allow for a bit better code organization in some cases, so thanks for it.</p>
