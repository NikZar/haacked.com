message: <p>That's how I felt originally. But recently when I rewrote my blog I decided to move to Disqus. I like that there's one dashboard where I can see replies to every comment I've posted using Disqus (makes replying very easy) and I can have one login instead of having to re-enter my details on every blog I go to.</p>
