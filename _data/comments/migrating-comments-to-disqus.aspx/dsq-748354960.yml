message: <p>Â Disqus says that you own your comments, they just host it. As for SEO, your native system should display the comments synced from Disqus in plain text so pages with JavaScript disabled can see them, and if JavaScript is enabled the Disqus system should hide the plain text comments and load it's embed instead. This works with the WordPress plugin for a fact.</p>
