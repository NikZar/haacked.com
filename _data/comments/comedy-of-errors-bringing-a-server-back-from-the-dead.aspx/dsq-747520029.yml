message: "<p>I can relate to the OS installation wiping your external drive. <br>In fact, something similar happened TWICE. The first time, I lost backups on my external drive. <br>The second time, I sort of forgot that the install displays your drives in the order they were plugged in (i.e. SATA0 is the first, SATA1 is the second, etc). Well, my C: drive had been SATA1 so I wiped my data drive. Needless to say, I actually did lose data in that one.<br>If you give Mozy (or some other service) a try, I'd be interested in hearing your experiences with it.</p>"
