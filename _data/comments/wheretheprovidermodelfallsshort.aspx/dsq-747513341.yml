message: <p>Well when I say dynamic SQL, I mean via some sort of dynamic SQL engine as in an ORM mapper.  I wouldn't dare generate dynamic SQL in my own code.<br><br><br><br>Using something like NHibernate or iBatis or LLBLGEN Pro provides much of the benefits of stored procs.  Via their APIs, you get security against SQL injection attacks, etc...<br><br><br><br>You use the API, they generate the safe SQL using prepared statements.  The first time a prepared statement runs, it takes a bit longer since the query is optimized. Afterwards it will run much faster.<br><br><br><br>Even if the perf was a bit slower, the benefits are worth it in portability, and potentially faster coding.</p>
