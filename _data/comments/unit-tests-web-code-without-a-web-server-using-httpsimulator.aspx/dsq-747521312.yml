message: <p>Erm Phil.... the download link to <a href="http://haacked.com/code/HttpSimulator.zip" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://haacked.com/code/HttpSimulator.zip">http://haacked.com/code/HttpSimulator.zip</a> leads to a 404. I tried <a href="http://code.haacked.com/HttpSimulator.zip" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://code.haacked.com/HttpSimulator.zip">http://code.haacked.com/HttpSimulator.zip</a> as well and failed. It appears to be available on <a href="http://www.pudn.com/downloads169/sourcecode/windows/csharp/detail777203.html" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.pudn.com/downloads169/sourcecode/windows/csharp/detail777203.html">www.pudn.com/.../detail777203.html</a> where I would have to become a VIP member to download the source. Not very happy that they are requiring registration to get to your code that you used to provide freely.</p>
