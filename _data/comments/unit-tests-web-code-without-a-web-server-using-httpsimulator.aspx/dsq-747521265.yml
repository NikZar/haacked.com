message: <p>Excellent work!!<br>Now... I have a problem trying to use Sessions between calls that I need to simulate. I need to make one call, which saves data to the Session. I then need to make another call using the same session to check stuff that happens if a session already exists.<br>Is there an existing way to do this or would I need to customise the HttpSimulator?</p>
