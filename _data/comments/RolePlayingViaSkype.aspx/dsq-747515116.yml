message: <p>I was just thinking the same thing. I <i>am</i> in highschool, but we all have busy schedules and can't seem to get a group together. I'm just dying to find others to get skype and campaign with me. Browsing various search engines, I came across your site virtually alone mentioning the keywords in this idea. Quite disappointing, but I hope that Skype will grow and more RPers will catch on to the concept. I'll keep my fingers crossed for the future of roleplaying. :-D<br>~Darcy</p>
