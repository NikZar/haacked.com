message: <p>I know you will look into publishing scenarios later in  the cicle closer to release, but meanwhile I have to report that now "publish" from within vs2010 does not include most of cshtml files, even more it confused me with including some of them.<br>should be more consistent way to include all assemblies needed to run mvc3 razor website into bin directory.<br>Keep up the good work.
