message: <p>You should give ReverseDOS from <a href="http://angrypets.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="angrypets.com">angrypets.com</a> a try.  I'm a small traffic site, but I was seeing 5-6 comment spams along with 30-40 trackback/referrer spams everyday before I tried RDOS.  Now I'm more or less spam free.  I may see one referrer spam every other week, but I just add them to the filter list and their done.</p>
