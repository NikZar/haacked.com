message: <p>Chris, that's interesting since most examples I've seen don't use events.  The reason I started examining the event approach is that it decouples the view and presenter just a bit more.  For example, the view doesn't need to know which methods of the presenter to call, it just raises its events as it normally does.<br>Most examples I've seen take the approach that you take and I think it may well end up being more readable.  I'm still experimenting with different approaches.</p>
