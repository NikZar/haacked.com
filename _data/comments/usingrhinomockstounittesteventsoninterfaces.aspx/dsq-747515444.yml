message: <p>Hey Phil.<br>I've been playing with this, and read yours and Boodhoo's articles.  He does not show an example of the concrete view code, and I was wondering if there any way around the awkward event wiring code in the concrete view?  It seems confusing and redundant to have to wire up a "dummy" event in the codebehind that then checks to see if the Handler has subscribers, and if so, evokes the Handler.</p>
