message: '<p>Could you do a post for those of us who must use SVN to sync at work but would like to use GH4W to track changes locally? All of your posts say we have to make a local clone to start using GH4W, but what if I want to create my own repo out of thin air: do I have to drop down to the command line and create a repo from there?</p>'
