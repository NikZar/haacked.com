message: <p>Like Paco said, the ThreadPool threads in your asp.NET application are used by the asp.NET worker process threads. I believe you have 32 on a default configuration.  The more you use to run 'background work' the less simultaneous requests you can handle, right up to 0 requests if you queue up too much background work.</p>
