message: <p>Nice post.  There's also the issue that whatever TDD you *can* do on a GUI stops some fraction of bugs from ever getting to beta users or testers in the first place.  That's a huge chunk of efficiency for the team as a whole.  And I really don't think you want beta users to see a lot of defects in a GUI at any stage.</p>
