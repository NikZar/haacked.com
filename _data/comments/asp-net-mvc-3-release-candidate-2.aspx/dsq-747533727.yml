message: <p>@Adam that would break all extension methods on the ViewDataDictionary for everyone.<br>@Igm Could you provide more details? I'm not able to reproduce this on a brand new MVC 3 project. Do you still have references to WebMatrix.Data and/or WebMatrix.WebData? Those references are no longer needed.</p>
