message: "<p>Great job guys! I've read the ScottGu's blog today. You have included some cool stuff in the RC 2. The installation and everything else passed good for me. However, I just saw in the <a href=\"http://asp.net\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"asp.net\">asp.net</a> forums a user have reported problem with the Nullable parameters sent to the Controller's method.
