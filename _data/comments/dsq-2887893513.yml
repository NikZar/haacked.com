message: <p>My husband and I have been together for 7 1/2 years. Well Thursday nite we had a stupid argument over money and stuff and Friday morning, he left me. I Dont Know What To Do! I can’t eat,I can’t sleep. I’m so lost. I’ve been divorced before but I initiated that one because he was abusive. But this time I don’t want it. Yes we fight a lot and he and I have both said things to each other that we both regret but I Still Love Him and don’t want him to divorce me. He says he still loves me and he says he misses me and my kids but he is done. How can I convince him that I will do what ever it takes to save our marriage since i contacted Dr. Ikhine via agbadado@gmail.com everything has change and my problems was solve.</p>
