message: <p>The author rightly says a developer must feel the pain first before generalizing. But foreseeing the pain and not generalizing is just being plain lazy. copy-pasting of code, only make the developers life more difficult.<br>From my experience, avoiding generalization always and diving straight into the problem hoping you would do it only if required sometimes costs more (time) than if you had designed and generalized the problem to begin with.</p>
