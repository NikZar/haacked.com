message: <p>Do you use a different color theme in Visual Studio?  Do you switch it back to the default?  I much prefer to develop with a dark them with lighter text, but the default Black/Blue on White Visual Studio color scheme is much less distracting for an audience as everyone's used to it, even if they dont use it themselves.</p>
