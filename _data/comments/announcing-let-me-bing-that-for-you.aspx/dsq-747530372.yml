message: <p>There's so many negative comments. :(<br>Yeah, you did copy someone's idea, but I don't think that is bad.  I was doing a lmgtfy and thought "what an ugly interface... I wonder if someone made a Bing version..."<br>I would like to say thank you for such a good and useful website.<br>Only suggestion I have is to use an Aero style cursor with a shadow (probably a PNG).</p>
