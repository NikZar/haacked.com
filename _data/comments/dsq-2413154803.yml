message: <p>Really? Not sure I agree with that. String has properties too, has more public methods than DateTime (String = 132 vs DateTime = 93) and String implementation has almost twice as much code as DateTime - I think String is clearly more complex than DateTime if looking at API surface or implementation</p>
