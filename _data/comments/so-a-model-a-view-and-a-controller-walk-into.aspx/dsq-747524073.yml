message: <p>It should be:<br>&lt;blackquote&gt;<br>So a Model, a View, and a Controller walk into a bar and sit down to order some drinks from the bartender. The Model has a few more drinks than the others and turns to the Controller and says,<br>“Can you give me a ride home tonight? I know I always burden you with this and never ask View, but I can never depend on that guy. <br>Controller turns to View and says, <br>"Model is way to drunk so give him a ride home you have no voice here - bitch!”<br>&lt;/blackquoute&gt;<br>:)</p>
