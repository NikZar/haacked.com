message: "<p>I totally recognized myself in that comic when I saw it. Like, going on Amazon and obsessing about the one bad review for my books. OMG.<br>I am really blessed with my OSS code and its community in that they provide constructive feedback and usually have a big thank you somewhere in their emails/tweets that helps to accept whatever they have to say about the quality of the code (or lack thereof). But yeah, I cannot agree more with you about what you say: Trying to put yourself in the user's shoes and understanding what they go through and why they are having the issue, and why it matters to them, it's really a big mark of respect, and it doesn't go unnoticed.<br>Cheers<br>Laurent</p>"
