message: <p>I love your blog Phil. Great post. It's nice to know that there are other developers out there struggling with the same issues that I am.<br>On your post, the big question is - how do you get there, in this mindset. You know sometimes comments turn to insults and really get to me (or maybe they're not insults but my critique tolerance drastically drops when it comes to my code). <br>I guess part of it is that we really LOVE to code and take our work seriously. I'll try to look at things a little bit differently from now on.</p>
