message: <p>There are some people who are naturally argumentative. Most of the time it's great, they raise good points for you to take on-board and improve.<br>I've learned recently that there are the people who combine being argumentative and pigheaded. Facts don't matter to them, you're wrong and they will make sure everyone knows that. Not caring about these kind of people is something you have to learn.</p>
