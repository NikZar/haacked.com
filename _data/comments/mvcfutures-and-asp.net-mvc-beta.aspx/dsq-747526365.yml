message: <p>I wish you guys didn't drop the strongly type generic action links into futures, they are awesome! None the less, seeing how the framework has evolved at every step of the way I've come to love MS's implementation of Mvc. It has lead to some seriously rapid dev for me and my team, seriously looking forward to beta, you guys have done a wicked job!</p>
