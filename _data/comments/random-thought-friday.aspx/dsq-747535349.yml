message: <p>One of the things I like about starting a new blog was that there are no readers. Once it starts growing and I get a regular audience I fall into the trap of feeling like I need to put more work into each post which leads to me posting less.<br>I haven't solved the balance between having more decent posts and fewer 'high quality' posts.</p>
