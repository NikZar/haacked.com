message: <p>I don't believe that DJs are paid $50K for 3 hours of work.  They're really being paid for 3 hours of visible work, plus the countless hours of background research time, the cost of their media, and so on.  I suspect that like software managers, DJ managers don't recognize this background time as "productive" and overbook their stars.</p>
