message: <p>"These are all noble goals."<br>I agree, however none of these are new. The Pragmatic Programmer told us most of this stuff several years ago (although some of the buzzwords may have been different). I suspect even then it probably wasn't new. So, I have trouble understanding why ALT.NET is a 'movement'. It just seems like the same advice repackaged.<br>I see people write as if ALT.NET is some new revelation, it's not. I've yet to see any new ideas from people promoting the term. The most notable impact I see is the 'I'm one of these guys' effect. BTW, your agile analogy is good, because it has suffered from the same effect. Currently, ALT.NET seems to reflect a club mentality more than anything. People look for ways to associate themselves rather than understand the intent.<br>FWIW, I agree with some of the CodeBetter criticisms. There is a lot of negativity there...usually you have to wade through it to extract anything useful (which is why I rarely read their blogs).</p>
