message: <p>Phil,<br>Thanks for your post. I didn't mean to throw out the baby with the bath water, but I guess it sure looks that way. I meant to say that these things have value but value at the code level, and that there is much more to a world of IT and Software Development. I'm tired of all the fighting, the constant view that everyone else is doing it "wrong."</p>
