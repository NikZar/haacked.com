message: <p>I just finished up a similar background scheduler but I wasn't sure how to handle app domain shutdowns. Thanks for the code. Very helpful!<br>It would be great if we had a way for ASP.NET apps to register scheduled tasks outside of the web app domain but sandboxed to only access their parent application. Kind of a safe way to allow a medium trust web app to add a windows scheduled task. Just brainstorming...</p>
