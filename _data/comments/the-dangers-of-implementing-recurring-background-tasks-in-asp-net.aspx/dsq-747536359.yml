message: <p>I was doing recurring background tasks in 2 applications (running another thread and executing a method every x minutes), and I had no crash till now at all.<br>Though, seems that I was a lucky guy. I think a better, easier approach is to let a windows server (or another single ASP.NET application) run the recurring task. This is easier to me.<br>Thanks.</p>
