message: <p>In the code sample above, is there no need for the SampleAspNetTimer class to ever detect app shutdown? <br>If the JoBHost surfaced a "Stopped" property it could stop the timer at the right time, but the fact that you haven't done that suggests that it's not needed, and IIS will tear it down anyway.</p>
