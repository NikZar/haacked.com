message: <p>Separate DLL. I started out with 1 test assembly per release assembly but that proved too tedious to maintain with the continuous integration build. Now I have 1 assembly for unit tests (across the solution) and 1 assembly for integration tests).<br>I do leave some types public that should really be internal but I try and hide these with a more detailed namespace.</p>
