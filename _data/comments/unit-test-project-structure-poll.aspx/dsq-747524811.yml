message: <p>I remember before all these xunit programs were well known having a static void main in each java class that tested that class and were executed in batch from the command line.<br>Things sure have changed though and these xunit frameworks are great. Putting all that test code in the main project has a bad smell to me.  Looks like lots of people smell that too :)</p>
