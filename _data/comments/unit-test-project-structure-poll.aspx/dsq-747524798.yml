message: <p>Another Microsoftie spouting off on TDD when they clearly don't....  Oh, wait... sorry, this was supposed to go on Rob's blog ;)<br>I'm with you Phil.  The last thing I want on my webserver is a bunch of code that will never execute (and should never execute in production).  On the web, every byte counts, whether it is traveling across the wire or consuming server memory.</p>
