message: <p>I sometimes consider pulling a Helen Keller and just writing messages to other people.<br><br><br><br>I also have a horrible conversational memory.  At a previous job, I was trying to mediate a conflict between two people (one above me and one below) and I carried a notepad writing down what everyone was saying so I could get to the bottom of the misunderstanding.  And it's always a misunderstanding.</p>
