message: <p>Is old news necessarily bad news?  And, anyway who comments on a blog when they already know something?  If that's the case most people would have to spend all their time online tagging up a bunch of blogs, telling bloggers that their sites are stale.  Of course, if you don't know much, then this doesn't take very long.  I can only assume that Mr. anonymous (is that French?) is of the latter persuasion.</p>
