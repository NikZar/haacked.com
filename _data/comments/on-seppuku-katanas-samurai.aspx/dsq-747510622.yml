message: <p>actually, while harakiri and seppuku do contain the same kanji, the reason why they are pronounced differently is because the kanji characters are reversed. ^_^ (??) is hara-kiri. (??) is seppuku. seppuku is considered the proper term because hara-kiri sounds more vulgar (a comparison i could make would be non-literal tranlations of the words to "ritual disembowlment" [seppuku] and "cutting the stomach" [hara-kiri]).<br><br><br><br>this was very interesting. :] thanks for posting.</p>
