message: <p>It is a tanto, a very beautiful one. I collect old blades as well, mostly anything Japanese as well as Arming swords. I also collect Shinken, but prefer nihonto xP Please respect that tanto, it is worth a lot of money, not to mention it deserves respect. Also, to all of you who say you "own" antiques, you do not own them.I am in the JSSUS ,Antique blades are not meant to be owned, they are meant to be taken care of for your life, then passed on for another generation to care for (hopefully the new generation will CARE for it xD) Anyways, exquisite blade and nice information.</p>
