message: <p>Erm, that isn't a katana you have there... In fact it is a Tanto. It is the smaller sword in a samurai's Daisho (Meaning Big and Small literally) But most of the time it is a Wakizashi and a Katana. It is more often used when an impractical Katana couldnt be (Enclosed spaces). Im starting to think it is a Wakizashi actually, because Samurai tend to use the wakizashi for Seppuku instead of the tanto. Hope that helped</p>
