message: <p>Although these days, not even the scientific method will avail you. Especially if it's something that's inherently subjective or very complex that objectivity becomes problematic.<br>In my experience, the best way is to listen to those that tell you you're wrong (even when it hurts) and try to prove them wrong.<br>I've proven myself into and out of many biases by arguing (in the good sense of the word). Trying to prove someone wrong, for me, provides a useful motivation for doing the research and legwork. Frequently during that process I realize that I'm the wrong one and come around to the correct assumption.  Many times, I find out both me and my counterpart were wrong and come up with some other solution entirely.<br>Comfort, as your post alludes to, is the great enemy. Scientific method, rational argumentation, apologetics (defending your ideas) are all means of getting us out of our ruts and into "thinking mode."</p>
