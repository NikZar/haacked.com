message: <p>Ok I'm gonna bite. I agree with his core question and that is where is the simplicity? For example, Linq to SQL works. You open it, drop your database tables on it, save and then write some queries. I can show it to a developer and he is able to rock and roll in 15 minutes.<br>We need more stuff like that :)<br>But then there is stuff that I could spend an entire day and I could not explain it to an advanced developer.</p>
