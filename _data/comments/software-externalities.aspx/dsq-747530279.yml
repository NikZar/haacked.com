message: <p>I agree with you Phil.  I have been presented without countless projects where I was told to get it out as quickly as possible and not worry about "tomorrow" because it is an app that will only be used for a short time.  Those apps are still running today.  <br>I think that project managers are under such pressure to deliver more for less.  It is easy for them to cut out things that add hours even though those same "things" will save the company down the line.</p>
