message: <p>I so agree with this blog post. I see that lately your blog is getting more "political".<br>Anyways, I remember few years ago when doing an internship at some big company in France. They asked me to update a VBA "tool" that grew and grew into an unmaintainable application with 10 spreadsheets. They suddenly wanted this tool to be used in different call centers (it was a support calls routing helper) and even accross different continents. They never thought that having different Excel versions or just language packs would make the application obsolete.<br>As you say "Fortunately, the externalities of these applications didnâ€™t cause cancer". but they do cause headaches and a lot of WTF.<br>They also discredit our profession sometimes.</p>
