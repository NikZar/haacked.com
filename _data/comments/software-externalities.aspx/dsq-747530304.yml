message: <p>@John, @lynn I think part of the problem in this discussion is I agree with lynn that Agile is tangential to the point. If that's the case, why was it brought in the first place. It feels like a strawman to me. "Let me point out another thing Agile doesn't address, which it doesn't even try to address nor should it.".<br>If agile is tangential to the point, then why even mention it in the first place?</p>
