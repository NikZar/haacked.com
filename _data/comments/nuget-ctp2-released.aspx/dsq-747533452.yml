message: <p>Dunno if this happened to anybody else, but when I installed via the extension manager the vsix installer executable started freaking out, recursively spawning another process.  Had to kill the process tree a few times until it actually killed the leading edge of the tree.  I'd guess it was a fluke, but it was definitely weird.</p>
