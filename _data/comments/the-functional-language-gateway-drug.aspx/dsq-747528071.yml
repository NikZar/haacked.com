message: <p>@Justin it is possible to manually set the slug when you write a blog post, so there's always that option. I wonder if I should just append a number at the end after the first six cases so there's an infinite possible titles for those who are lazy. ;)<br>@others, yeah I need to increment tryCount.</p>
