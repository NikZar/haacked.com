message: <p>I read Part 1, 2, and 3 of your articles on copyrighting software.  I modified portions of code on an action wizard (javascripts) offered for free by Adobe at <a href="https://www.pdfscripting.com/public/main.cfm" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.pdfscripting.com/public/main.cfm">https://www.pdfscripting.co...</a>.  I modified it enough for it to fall under the definition of a derivative.  I looked at the legal statements at  <a href="https://www.adobe.com/legal/terms.html" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.adobe.com/legal/terms.html">https://www.adobe.com/legal...</a> and it appears that all of their works are copyrighted and under section 5 called "User Conduct," it cannot be modified.  However, I am still unclear if I can copyright my portion of the modified code as a derivative per section 3 "Your Content" section.  The two sections seem to conflict.  Maybe you can help me sort this out?  I would like to copyright as a derivative ASAP if I am allowed to.  Thanks in advance.</p>
