message: <p>I sorta wish that DateTime was a reference type, instead of a value type.  Then I wouldn't have to fool around with Nullable&lt;datetime&gt;'s as much when I want to represent something that might have a date, or might have not date.  Particularly when those things go into databases, where the range of the .Net DateTime doesn't match up with the T-SQL datetime.</p>
