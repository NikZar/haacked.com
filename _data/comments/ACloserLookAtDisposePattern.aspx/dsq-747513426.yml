message: <p>Template method is good only when you have one derived behavior and not a chain of derived classes. Suppose you have another class derived from the derive class. If this class overrides the ReleaseUnmanagedResources(); We will miss the call to the middle class (the derive) ReleaseUnmanagedResources().<br>This is why in such scenarios you use the base class call.<br></p>
