message: <p>Hi Mike, living in Europe is not a problem. I think it's a fine place to live, I've done it myself. :)<br>Now if you want to take this position, living in Europe isn't a problem, staying in Europe is :P. I believe the position requires relocation to Redmond. Sorry.<br>But I must say, it's really nice here. :)</p>
