message: <p>I would go back with a list of all sports results from the time I travel back to to the present. I would then go to the betting shops and put accumulator bets on all teams (I do football bets, or soccer to you) for every week. <br>A Â£1 bet could easily make you 2 million back. So as to not be suspicious you would bet with different companies and spread them out so that you may win one or two big bets a year. Plus smaller ones that you can get other people to collect.<br></p>
