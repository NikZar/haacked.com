message: <p>I have a better rule for THAT mailing list that I think you are indirectly talking about. I just set up a GMail filter that dumps any subject that contains any version of "Out of office" and "autoreply" in various languages. It takes a little while to train it, but it is SOOOOOO worth it.</p><p>At work I generally only turn on OOF replies for internal emails. And then I try to include a little rhyme or song in the message.</p>
