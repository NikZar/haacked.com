message: <p>How would you know if the initial mail is from a list? If it came from something like @lists.contoso.com I guess you'd know, but not everybody does that. Then you're back to putting the onus on the user to set up multiple filters and stuff for auto-replies, which a lot of clients don't support.</p>
