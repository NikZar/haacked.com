message: <p>Phil I watched the PDC video and though it was a pretty cool presentation. I work with ASP.NET for a while now but Ruby on Rails is my hobby. I think you guys did a great job in the MVC framework. I still think Ruby's dynamic features make Rails a little easier to work with the MVC. On the other hand there are many of my peers that would argue that the strong typed features on C# are a good thing. I think there are good and bad in both approaches, there is no silver bullet (unfortunately). In spite of these different points of view I think you are going in the right direction with MVC. Thanks for all the effort.<br>Oh, you also convinced me that the 1's you got on the presentation were a mistake do to the page's display error. :)</p>
