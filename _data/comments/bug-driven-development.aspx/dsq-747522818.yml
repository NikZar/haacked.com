message: <p>In relation to mr teflon, working as a single developer is much much easier.  I once worked on a project with a few junior developers and the bugs spiraled out of control.  I then kicked them off the project and we went to only one developer and the bugs started to disappear.  While this is not always an option if you can create functional silos in the code and then assign responsibility to individuals you will tend to be better off.</p>
