message: <p>Thanks for the update - it will probably take more than that to convince me that VS2010 isn't a sort of geological disaster!  Actually, my general belief is that VS has made itself far too dependent on far too much stuff, so I shouldn't really complain if the deps I want aren't in the box...</p>
