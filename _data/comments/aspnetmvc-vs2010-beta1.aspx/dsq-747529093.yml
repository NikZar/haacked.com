message: <p>I love what you guys have done with MVC. I've been using it since preview 1. I've was reading the "what's new" for ASP.NET 4.0 and wondering what the roadmap is for MVC 2.0. Will VS 2010 just ship MVC 1.0 with MVC 2.0 coming out-of-band? And is there any news on what kind of goodies we can see in 2.0?</p>
