message: <p>Hey, Phil...I can definitely see the need for a close, but why not use the .toggle() which would allow for showing the hidden div again. I know, it starts to approach a rudimentary accordion, but I would hate to have to reload an entire page just to get the hidden content back into view.<br>Just my two cents...after taxes, probably worthless!<br>Ric</p>
