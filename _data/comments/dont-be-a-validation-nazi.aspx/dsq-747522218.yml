message: <p>Good point on the email address validation. However, it seems like most of the time I'm handed the requirement to include this validation on the desktop apps and web apps I write. If I can cover whatever the sponsoring user thinks a valid email should be, then they're happy. I prefer to leave it as a free-form entry if I can though.</p>
