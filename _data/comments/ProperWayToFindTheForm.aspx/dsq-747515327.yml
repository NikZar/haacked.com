message: <p>We ran into a similar issue, but the problem was with multiple forms.  A designer had sent us a dreamweaver page we used as a master page.  Postbacks didn't work until we realized he'd put a second form for a little side-bar search. .NET was finding the wrong form to attach it's handlers. We were able to remove it in that case, but I could imagine some where it may not be possible...</p>
