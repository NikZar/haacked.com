message: <p>I use the Factory Support Facility from Castle Windsor to achieve exactly what you're trying here. I essentially have a "ProviderFactory" class with a method CreateMembershipProvider that instantiates it from the web.config. <br>Sorry I don't have the code with me (it's at work) but a quick search for Factory Support should get you what you're after.<br>Hope this helps.</p>
