message: <p>These properties are all actually just functions that convert the internal value of the DateTime and return a piece of it. It is no different from calling Substring(...) on a string, besides the fact they have a predefined piece they cut out and return. It's the same as if you'd have properties like "FirstLetter" and "LastLetter" on a string.</p>
