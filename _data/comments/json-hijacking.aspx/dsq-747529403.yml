message: <p>The acronym JSON (pronounced like the name “Jason”) stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It’s a way of annotating data that’s relatively easy for humans to read and write. This helps explain its recent popularity. As Ajax applications, which depend heavily on JavaScript, have become common, programmers have searched for an easy way to transfer data. Converting JSON to something usable in JavaScript takes one line of code and automatically works in all browsers.<br></p>
