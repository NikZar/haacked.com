message: <p>Few days ago whenever i was opening my chrome it automatically redirected towards Start.MySearchDial. com. First i think that it is a normal issue so i try to restart my browser. But the problem was still there. Finally i went to an expert and ask is that a big issue. What i get to know is really shocking. He told me that my computer was attacked with a salacious domain which is known as a browser hijacker. As the name sound it can hijack almost any browser which is used on the infected computer and that happens to my browser also.</p><p>The developer of these kinds of domain are really sharp minded and they use it to generate money. These kind of domains remains associated with some other third party or commercial website and it use to promote such site to get some money. So once it get inside your computer, it will first change the default setting of whatever browser you use. You will also see that your homepage also get replaced with Start.MySearchDial. com. But it not stops here. You will get annoyed from its malicious activity. Whenever you open your browser it automatically open in a new tab or when you open any website it will display various kind of ads on them.</p><p>It is my personal experience that avoid clicking on such ads. Because if you do so then you will be redirected towards its sponsored sites where you can get unreliable products. The worst thing which i know that browser hijacker can also track whatever you do on the Web. It collects your data and share it with hackers which they can use for bad cause. In order to avoid it don't visit unsafe site or avoid clicking on random links or pop-ups. Well, i was also suffering from this threat but searching lot on Internet i reached <a href="http://www.start-mysearch.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.start-mysearch.com">http://www.start-mysearch.com</a> which really helps me to get rid of the issue. I think you should also try this.</p>
