message: <p>Excellent timing as today I am going to integrate NuGet support into my product.<br>One topic that I haven't found much information on is hosting a writable NuGet feed that will allow users to publish their packages, similar to the official NuGet backend. <br>This will be very useful for commercial applications or hosting a private service within a company.</p>
