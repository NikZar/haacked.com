The fundamental problem is that programmers and business users have a different perspective <a href="http://www.edmblog.com/weblog/2005/08/different_persp.html" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.edmblog.com/weblog/2005/08/different_persp.html">that makes it hard for them to collaborate</a>. Yelling at programmers won't help.<br>JT</p>
