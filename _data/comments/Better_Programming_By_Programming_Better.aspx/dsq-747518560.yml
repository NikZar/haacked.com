message: <p>This topic is one we often discuss at work.<br>At one level, I think it comes down to motivation. The best developers I know, actually spend time trying to become better. They write code at home, they try new things, they study best practices and design patterns. Their skill is independent of formal education.<br>One issue may be, the schools don't really know how to teach programming yet. Sure they can give you the syntax, mechanics, and theory but, actual coding takes something else.<br>Currently "effortful study" in programming is only happening on the individual level. This has led many of us to theorize that the best way to go forward is through apprenticeship programs. But, even that is no silver bullet (who and how do you pick the masters to take apprentices?).</p>
