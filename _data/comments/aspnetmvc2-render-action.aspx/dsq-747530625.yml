message: <p><strong>ChildActionOnlyAttribute to let through Ajax requests</strong>.<br>As I've skimmed this attribute's code it seems that it only passes through requests when a certain action is called using Html.Action/RenderAction. This is probably not exactly how it should work. It should also pass through all Ajax requests because we could make an Ajax request to return a partial view.<br><strong>Forms in partial views</strong><br>Let's say I have a controller that returns a partial view with a comments form. I call this controller action within NewsPost.aspx view which also has a general partial view "Quick Search" displayed on the same page with a separate form element. If I write<br><code><br>using(Html.BeginForm())<br>{<br>    ...<br>}<br></code><br>in both partial views (rendered with RenderAction()), where will those two views post back? To the URL of the main view maybe?<br>So if I set a certain controller and action in my BeginForm() will still present me with other problems, since I won't know what to return from my controller action... I don't know which view vas displayed on the client to return the same one, and returning a partial view won't work either, since it was a full page post...<br><strong>How do I do this kind of scenarios?</strong></p>
