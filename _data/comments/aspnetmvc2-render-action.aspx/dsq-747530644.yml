message: <p>So...help me understand the differences between Html.RenderAction and Html.Action. Is it that Html.RenderAction will render the result directly to the Response (which is more efficient if returning a large amount of HTML). Whereas Html.Action returns a string with the result. Is this correct?<br></p>
