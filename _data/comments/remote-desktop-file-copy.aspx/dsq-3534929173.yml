message: <p>I was using windows 8 and robocopy for remote file transfer which is like rsync in linux but there are many complications in using it. I never came across a free tool which could help me in solving the slow transfer speed and other problems. After searching a lot I found GS Richcopy 360 which really helped me in solving this problem thanks to its multi threaded file transfer. I loved using it, you can also try it. Maybe it can help you too!</p>
