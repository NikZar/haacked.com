message: <p>Yes, this is nice, but be careful... I think when using the clipboard to copy files between machines, if you are copying a big file, and then happen to copy something else to your clipboard, it will cancel the original file copy!<br>(I haven't proven this yet, but having had several files mysteriously stop copying for no apparent reason recently, this appears to be the problem)</p>
