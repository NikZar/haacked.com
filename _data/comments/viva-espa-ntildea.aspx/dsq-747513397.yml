message: <p>As a spanish reader of your blog, I wish that you will have a great travel in Spain.<br><br>In Madrid, don't forget to go to the area of Calle Huertas. It's the best animated street in Madrid (Friday and Saturday). Lots of "bares", "garitos", etc.  Great ambient.<br><br><br><br>Saludos <br><br></p>
