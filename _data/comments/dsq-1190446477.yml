message: <p>As a Wikipedian myself I find it fair to say that the Wikipedia article is quite bad - especially with the (possible) difference between late binding, structural typing and duck typing. I already cleaned up the F# section a little after Lipperts post. Help - especially in the form of sources that describe the difference - would be greatly appreciated. I have the feeling though that even in the litterature duck-typing and the contrast to late binding and structural typing is currently ill defined.</p>
