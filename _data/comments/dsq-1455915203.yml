message: '<p>I added this!  I simply reverted most of the version references from 12 to 11, and then with a Tweak from Jared Parson it should work with 2012 and 2013.  There is a Pull Request open right now for it: <a href="https://github.com/Haacked/Encourage/pull/8" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://github.com/Haacked/Encourage/pull/8">https://github.com/Haacked/...</a></p>'
