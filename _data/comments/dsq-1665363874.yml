message: <p>i want to share my testimony, I was married to my husband for nine years before he left for another woman it was so bad that it affect my job to shorten the story it all ended when I meet with a great spiritualist who prayed for me. In relationships we need a lot of spiritual help he told me my problems and they where all true he prayed for me and after four days my husband who had abandoned me for two years already came to my door with some red rose flower asking me to take him back, we talked for some time and after two weeks we renewed our wedding vows and we are happy together now. If you want to contact the spiritualist you can contact him personally for help on prophetjamesspelltemple@hotmail.com he is a father figure with great powers</p>
