message: <p>cute!  tri-color striping...  I appreciate the:<br>1) link to the rail perspective<br>2) the attention to the community<br>3) the clever solution to the cycle problem - although I think class swapping for row coloring is better handled by jquery.<br>4) the entire mvc stack, of course</p>
