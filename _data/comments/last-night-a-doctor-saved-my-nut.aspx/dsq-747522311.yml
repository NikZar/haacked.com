message: <p>Actually, I think it is a really good idea to deviate from content for just these kinds of purposes. Honestly, if doing a basic web search did not provide any decent hits; I think it's your duty as a person with a popular site to publish such a story.<br>PS - Yes, that actually was one of my favorite Venture Bros. episodes as well!</p>
