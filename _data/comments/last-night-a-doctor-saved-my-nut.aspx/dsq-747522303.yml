message: <p>The beauty of this story is that you didn't need to add anything to make it funny, all you had to do was have the balls to tell the story.... to the whole world.  <br>Funny how a story's humor is amplified by the size of the audience.<br>(PS @The China Tattler... just because one finds humor in a story does not mean that they don't understand the severity... if anything it serves as a mnemonic device)</p>
