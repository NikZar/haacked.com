message: <p>Thanks for this Phil.. My wife and I were both in tears... hers from laughter... mine from sympathy.<br>She asked if it was like having 'a stitch'.. I sat here dumbfounded... having 'a stitch' is a walk in the park compared to this.<br>And yeah, the google ads surrounding this are hilarious in the context of a 'geek' blog.<br>Cheers</p>
