message: <p>ffs Phil.  I'm sitting here with my legs *very* tightly together.  You know how it is when you hear stuff like this...the rest of us men totally sympathize.<br>Anyway...you did the right thing going in...rather than trying to be all macho about it.  Never mess around with the general health of your boys.  Glad everything turned out ok (get it?).</p>
