message: <p>If you can't find humor in a traumatic experience with a happy ending, then life must be a real drag.<br>I think the fact that I went to Google first is not only due to this day and age, but due to the hour, I'd hate to wake up a doctor I've never met (my HMO primary care physician) at 2AM.</p>
