message: <p>hehehehe, these kinds of ads remind of ads for musicians I'd read back when I was playing in a band. They would always end with "no posers" or "no lamers, mad licks only".<br><br><br><br>I'd always read those and wonder if anyone would say "Hey, this looks like a great band. I'm gonna call up and.....awwww damn. 'no posers'. Well that leaves me out"</p>
