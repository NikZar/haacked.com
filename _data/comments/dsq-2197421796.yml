message: <p>Last week I was knee deep in code I had written that I knew was going bad but I was already 20 days over the deadline (meant to be a 10 day task). I've began reading The Pragmatic Programmer and consuming as much as I can to help me improve. At a wall at the minute but I will get better.</p>
