message: <p>Phil, I do appreciate the explanation of all what is going on here, because its helpful for those of us that use MVC, but IMO Microsoft needs to be making an ever increasing effort to reduce the complexity of toolsets, especially not introducing new features that require you to remember "another thing". IMO existing features need to be refactored rather than compensating ones added.<br>I use a lot of MS tools, but I have had all I will ever want of compiling mental matrices of all the possible ways to get something to work in x version of a particular MS product.</p>
