message: <p>@Terry Brown does that really buy you anything? I personally see the bin_deployable folder as just an ancillary bin folder that has stuff my project needs at runtime but that I don't really care about.<br>I wouldn't mix those files into my packages since those are things I actually specifically care about.</p>
