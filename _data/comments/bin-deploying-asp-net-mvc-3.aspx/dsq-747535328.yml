message: <p>Haccked, I was trying to upload a new website, which was written using ASP.NET MVC 3, and guess what, the shared hosting didn't provide the installation for me. So, your post was a survivor for me. Many thanks for article. I simply copied the DLL files of MVC3 to the bin folder of the uploaded application, and everything now works like a charm.</p>
