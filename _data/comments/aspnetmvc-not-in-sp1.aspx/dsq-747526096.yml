message: <p>PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE try to get a good subcontroller infrastructure in there with the release.  That seems so much more important than AJAX helpers and other things that don't affect the overall structuring of an application.  I know you guys have said before that might have to wait for the next release, but PLEASE rethink it...</p>
