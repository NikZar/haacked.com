message: <blockquote>I asked Carl, our tester, to print out an Excel graph of our bug count over time.</blockquote><p><br>You <strong>print</strong> the bug list? Shouldn't that be zapped onto an LCD? Perhaps with some sexy WPF animations and sound effects when it changes? You could even zap it to one of those cool Nabaztag Wi-Fi bunnies. Think of the trees :-)<br>On second thoughts... don't do that. Keep coding like the ninjas you all are and RTM that sucker quickly.</p>
