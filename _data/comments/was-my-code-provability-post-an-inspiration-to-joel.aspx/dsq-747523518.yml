message: <p>Has Joel looked into .NET yet, or does he still consider it 'cover fire' from MS?  (How about frameworks in general?)  I am now re-connected with the blogosphere (subscribing to around 50 blogs now), but Joel's is not one of them this time around.  Doesn't sound like I'm missing out on much based on Anydiem's comment.  Am I wrong?</p>
