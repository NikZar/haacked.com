message: <p>One thing I'd ask myself is whether the convention actually adds any value. Does it improve readibility? Does it allow you to express an intent that would otherwise be lost or not clear? Does it help anyone in any way? In this particular case, no, no and no. So, keywords only all the way for me :-)</p>
