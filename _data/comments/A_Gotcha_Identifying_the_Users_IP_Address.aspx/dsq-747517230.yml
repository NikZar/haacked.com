message: <p>This is closely related to my work. I work for a mystery shopping based company which needs to gather stats for consumers without being detected. I researched dozens of ip hiders for windows servers. Anonymizer didn't meet our needs. I can recommend netconceal if you need to go thurther down the rout of tracing header/routes and how this is viable. (You might will keep in me in work someday) Meantime back to Saturday night television.</p>
