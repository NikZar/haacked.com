message: <p>Hey there! <br>Here's a link to a working <a href="http://vb.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="vb.net">vb.net</a> MVC example that uses JSON.  It's based on Phil's and a number of other bits here and there but it works!  <br>Pages and sorts and everything.  I tried to include good comments too.  <br>Hope this helps someone - it took me a long time to get it working.</p>
