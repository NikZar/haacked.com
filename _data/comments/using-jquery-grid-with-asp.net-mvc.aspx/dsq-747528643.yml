message: <p>Hey Phil,<br>Do you ever run into an issue where you add certain js files from jQuery and intellisense ($ &amp;&amp; jQuery) go away?  I've noticed this with sometimes the order of the js files or which ones I include, and in this case, included exactly the ones you have, but not getting intellisense for anything.<br>Ideas?</p>
